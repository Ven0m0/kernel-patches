Subject: [PATCH 10/10] sched/fair: Use all little CPUs for CPU-bound workloads

Running N CPU-bound tasks on an N CPUs platform:

- with asymmetric CPU capacity

- not being a DynamIq system (i.e. having a PKG level sched domain
  without the SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES flag set)

.. might result in a task placement where two tasks run on a big CPU
and none on a little CPU. This placement could be more optimal by
using all CPUs.

Testing platform:

  Juno-r2:
    - 2 big CPUs (1-2), maximum capacity of 1024
    - 4 little CPUs (0,3-5), maximum capacity of 383

Testing workload ([1]):

  Spawn 6 CPU-bound tasks. During the first 100ms (step 1), each tasks
  is affine to a CPU, except for:

    - one little CPU which is left idle.
    - one big CPU which has 2 tasks affine.

  After the 100ms (step 2), remove the cpumask affinity.

Behavior before the patch:

  During step 2, the load balancer running from the idle CPU tags sched
  domains as:

  - little CPUs: 'group_has_spare'. Cf. group_has_capacity() and
    group_is_overloaded(), 3 CPU-bound tasks run on a 4 CPUs
    sched-domain, and the idle CPU provides enough spare capacity
    regarding the imbalance_pct

  - big CPUs: 'group_overloaded'. Indeed, 3 tasks run on a 2 CPUs
    sched-domain, so the following path is used:

      group_is_overloaded()
      \-if (sgs->sum_nr_running <= sgs->group_weight) return true;

    The following path which would change the migration type to
    'migrate_task' is not taken:

      calculate_imbalance()
      \-if (env->idle != CPU_NOT_IDLE && env->imbalance == 0)

    as the local group has some spare capacity, so the imbalance
    is not 0.

  The migration type requested is 'migrate_util' and the busiest
  runqueue is the big CPU's runqueue having 2 tasks (each having a
  utilization of 512). The idle little CPU cannot pull one of these
  task as its capacity is too small for the task. The following path
  is used:

   detach_tasks()
   \-case migrate_util:
     \-if (util > env->imbalance) goto next;

After the patch:

As the number of failed balancing attempts grows (with
'nr_balance_failed'), progressively make it easier to migrate
a big task to the idling little CPU. A similar mechanism is
used for the 'migrate_load' migration type.

Improvement:

Running the testing workload [1] with the step 2 representing
a ~10s load for a big CPU:

  Before patch: ~19.3s
  After patch:  ~18s (-6.7%)
