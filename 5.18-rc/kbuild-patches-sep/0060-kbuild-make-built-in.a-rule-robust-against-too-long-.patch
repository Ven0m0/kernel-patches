Subject: [PATCH 60/63] kbuild: make built-in.a rule robust against too long
 argument error

Kbuild runs at the top of objtree instead of changing the working
directory to subdirectories. I think this design is nice overall but
some commands have a scalability issue.

The build command of built-in.a is one of them whose length scales with:

    O(D * N)

Here, D is the length of the directory path (i.e. $(obj)/ prefix),
N is the number of objects in the Makefile, O() is the big O notation.

The deeper directory the Makefile directory is located, the more easily
it will hit the too long argument error.

We can make it better. Trim the $(obj)/ by Make's builtin function, and
restore it by a shell command (sed).

With this, the command length scales with:

    O(D + N)

In-tree modules still have some room to the limit (ARG_MAX=2097152),
but this is more future-proof for big modules in a deep directory.

For example, you can build i915 as builtin (CONFIG_DRM_I915=y) and
compare drivers/gpu/drm/i915/.built-in.a.cmd with/without this commit.
