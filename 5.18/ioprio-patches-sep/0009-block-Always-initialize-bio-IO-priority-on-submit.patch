Subject: [PATCH 9/9] block: Always initialize bio IO priority on submit

Currently, IO priority set in task's IO context is not reflected in the
bio->bi_ioprio for most IO (only io_uring and direct IO set it). This
results in odd results where process is submitting some bios with one
priority and other bios with a different (unset) priority and due to
differing priorities bios cannot be merged. Make sure bio->bi_ioprio is
always set on bio submission.
