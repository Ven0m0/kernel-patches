Subject: [PATCH 1/4] btrfs: wait for actual caching progress during allocation

Recently we've been having mysterious hangs while running generic/475 on
the CI system.  This turned out to be something like this:

  Task 1
  dmsetup suspend --nolockfs
  -> __dm_suspend
   -> dm_wait_for_completion
    -> dm_wait_for_bios_completion
     -> Unable to complete because of IO's on a plug in Task 2

  Task 2
  wb_workfn
  -> wb_writeback
   -> blk_start_plug
    -> writeback_sb_inodes
     -> Infinite loop unable to make an allocation

  Task 3
  cache_block_group
  ->read_extent_buffer_pages
   ->Waiting for IO to complete that can't be submitted because Task 1
     suspended the DM device

The problem here is that we need Task 2 to be scheduled completely for
the blk plug to flush.  Normally this would happen, we normally wait for
the block group caching to finish (Task 3), and this schedule would
result in the block plug flushing.

However if there's enough free space available from the current caching
to satisfy the allocation we won't actually wait for the caching to
complete.  This check however just checks that we have enough space, not
that we can make the allocation.  In this particular case we were trying
to allocate 9MiB, and we had 10MiB of free space, but we didn't have
9MiB of contiguous space to allocate, and thus the allocation failed and
we looped.

We specifically don't cycle through the FFE loop until we stop finding
cached block groups because we don't want to allocate new block groups
just because we're caching, so we short circuit the normal loop once we
hit LOOP_CACHING_WAIT and we found a caching block group.

This is normally fine, except in this particular case where the caching
thread can't make progress because the DM device has been suspended.

Fix this by not only waiting for free space to >= the amount of space we
want to allocate, but also that we make some progress in caching from
the time we start waiting.  This will keep us from busy looping when the
caching is taking a while but still theoretically has enough space for
us to allocate from, and fixes this particular case by forcing us to
actually sleep and wait for forward progress, which will flush the plug.

With this fix we're no longer hanging with generic/475.

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] btrfs: free qgroup rsv on io failure

If we do a write whose bio suffers an error, we will never reclaim the
qgroup reserved space for it. We allocate the space in the write_iter
codepath, then release the reservation as we allocate the ordered
extent, but we only create a delayed ref if the ordered extent finishes.
If it has an error, we simply leak the rsv. This is apparent in running
any error injecting (dmerror) fstests like btrfs/146 or btrfs/160. Such
tests fail due to dmesg on umount complaining about the leaked qgroup
data space.

When we clean up other aspects of space on failed ordered_extents, also
free the qgroup rsv.

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] btrfs: fix start transaction qgroup rsv double free

btrfs_start_transaction reserves metadata space of the PERTRANS type
before it identifies a transaction to start/join. This allows flushing
when reserving that space without a deadlock. However, it results in a
race which temporarily breaks qgroup rsv accounting.

T1                                              T2
start_transaction
do_stuff
                                            start_transaction
                                                qgroup_reserve_meta_pertrans
commit_transaction
    qgroup_free_meta_all_pertrans
                                            hit an error starting txn
                                            goto reserve_fail
                                            qgroup_free_meta_pertrans (already freed!)

The basic issue is that there is nothing preventing another commit from
committing before start_transaction finishes (in fact sometimes we
intentionally wait for it) so any error path that frees the reserve is
at risk of this race.

While this exact space was getting freed anyway, and it's not a huge
deal to double free it (just a warning, the free code catches this), it
can result in incorrectly freeing some other pertrans reservation in
this same reservation, which could then lead to spuriously granting
reservations we might not have the space for. Therefore, I do believe it
is worth fixing.

To fix it, use the existing prealloc->pertrans conversion mechanism.
When we first reserve the space, we reserve prealloc space and only when
we are sure we have a transaction do we convert it to pertrans. This way
any racing commits do not blow away our reservation, but we still get a
pertrans reservation that is freed when _this_ transaction gets committed.

This issue can be reproduced by running generic/269 with either qgroups
or squotas enabled via mkfs on the scratch device.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] btrfs: wait on uncached block groups on every allocation
 loop

My initial fix for the generic/475 hangs was related to metadata, but
our CI testing uncovered another case where we hang for similar reasons.
We again have a task with a plug that is holding an outstanding request
that is keeping the dm device from finishing it's suspend, and that task
is stuck in the allocator.

This time it is stuck trying to allocate data, but we do not have a
block group that matches the size class.  The larger loop in the
allocator looks like this (simplified of course)

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

In my earlier fix we were trying to allocate from the block group, but
we weren't waiting for the progress because we were only waiting for the
free space to be >= the amount of free space we wanted.  My fix made it
so we waited for forward progress to be made as well, so we would be
sure to wait.

This time however we did not have a block group that matched our size
class, so what was happening was this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

The size_class_doesn't_match() part was true, so we'd just skip this
block group and never wait for caching, and then because we found a
caching block group we'd just go back and do the loop again.  We never
sleep and thus never flush the plug and we have the same deadlock.

Fix the logic for waiting on the block group caching to instead do it
unconditionally when we goto loop.  This takes the logic out of the
allocation step, so now the loop looks more like this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    if (loop > LOOP_CACHING_NOWAIT && !ffe_ctl->retry_uncached &&
        !ffe_ctl->cached) {
       ffe_ctl->retry_uncached = true;
       btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
    }

    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

This simplifies the logic a lot, and makes sure that if we're hitting
uncached block groups we're always waiting on them at some point.

I ran this through 100 iterations of generic/475, as this particular
case was harder to hit than the previous one.
