Subject: [PATCH 13/35] drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for AYA NEO
 Founder edition
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add quirk orientation for AYA NEO Founder. The name appears with spaces in
dmi strings as other devices of the brand. The panel is the same as the
NEXT and 2021 models. Those could not be reused as the former has VENDOR
name as "AYANEO" without spaces and the latter has "AYADEVICE".

Tested by the JELOS team that has been patching their own kernel for a
while now and confirmed by users in the AYA NEO and ChimeraOS discord
servers.
