Subject: [PATCH 09/13] cpufreq/amd-pstate: Remove the unnecessary
 cpufreq_update_policy call

The update_limits callback is only called in two conditions.

* When the preferred core rankings change. In which case, we just need to
change the prefcore ranking in the cpudata struct. As there are no changes
to any of the perf values, there is no need to call cpufreq_update_policy()

* When the _PPC ACPI object changes, i.e. the highest allowed Pstate
changes. The _PPC object is only used for a table based cpufreq driver
like acpi-cpufreq, hence is irrelevant for CPPC based amd-pstate.

Hence, the cpufreq_update_policy() call becomes unnecessary and can be
removed.
