Subject: [PATCH 3/5] MAINTAINERS: add myself to co-maintain ZSTD

Recently the ZSTD tree has been removed from linux-next due to lack of
updates for last year [1]. As there are several users of ZSTD in kernel
we need to keep the code maintained and updated. I'll act as a backup to
get the ZSTD upstream to linux, Nick is OK with that [2].
