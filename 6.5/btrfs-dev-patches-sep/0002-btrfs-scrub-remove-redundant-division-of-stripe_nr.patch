Subject: [PATCH 002/110] btrfs: scrub: remove redundant division of stripe_nr

Variable stripe_nr is being divided by map->num_stripes however the
result is never read. The division and assignment are redundant and
can be removed. Cleans up clang scan build warning:

fs/btrfs/scrub.c:1264:3: warning: Value stored to 'stripe_nr' is
never read [deadcode.DeadStores]

The code is a leftover from 6ded22c1bfe6 ("btrfs: reduce div64 calls by
limiting the number of stripes of a chunk to u32") that converted div64
to normal division, it's the same but previous version did not trigger a
warning.
