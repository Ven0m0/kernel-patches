Subject: [PATCH 38/46] ext4: mballoc: avoid garbage value from err

clang's static analysis warning: fs/ext4/mballoc.c
line 4178, column 6, Branch condition evaluates to a garbage value.

err is uninitialized and will be judged when 'len <= 0' or
it first enters the loop while the condition "!ext4_sb_block_valid()"
is true. Although this can't make problems now, it's better to
correct it.
