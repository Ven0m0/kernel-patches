Subject: [PATCH 01/23] ubsan: Clarify Kconfig text for CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP

Make it clearer in the one-line description and the verbose description
text that CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP as currently implemented involves a tradeoff of
much less helpful oops messages in exchange for a smaller kernel image.
(With the additional effect of turning UBSAN warnings into crashes, which
may or may not be desired.)
