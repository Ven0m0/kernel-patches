Subject: [PATCH 1/9] btrfs: wait on uncached block groups on every allocation
 loop

My initial fix for the generic/475 hangs was related to metadata, but
our CI testing uncovered another case where we hang for similar reasons.
We again have a task with a plug that is holding an outstanding request
that is keeping the dm device from finishing it's suspend, and that task
is stuck in the allocator.

This time it is stuck trying to allocate data, but we do not have a
block group that matches the size class.  The larger loop in the
allocator looks like this (simplified of course)

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

In my earlier fix we were trying to allocate from the block group, but
we weren't waiting for the progress because we were only waiting for the
free space to be >= the amount of free space we wanted.  My fix made it
so we waited for forward progress to be made as well, so we would be
sure to wait.

This time however we did not have a block group that matched our size
class, so what was happening was this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

The size_class_doesn't_match() part was true, so we'd just skip this
block group and never wait for caching, and then because we found a
caching block group we'd just go back and do the loop again.  We never
sleep and thus never flush the plug and we have the same deadlock.

Fix the logic for waiting on the block group caching to instead do it
unconditionally when we goto loop.  This takes the logic out of the
allocation step, so now the loop looks more like this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    if (loop > LOOP_CACHING_NOWAIT && !ffe_ctl->retry_uncached &&
        !ffe_ctl->cached) {
       ffe_ctl->retry_uncached = true;
       btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
    }

    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

This simplifies the logic a lot, and makes sure that if we're hitting
uncached block groups we're always waiting on them at some point.

I ran this through 100 iterations of generic/475, as this particular
case was harder to hit than the previous one.

Subject: [PATCH 2/9] btrfs: don't stop integrity writeback too early

extent_write_cache_pages stops writing pages as soon as nr_to_write hits
zero.  That is the right thing for opportunistic writeback, but incorrect
for data integrity writeback, which needs to ensure that no dirty pages
are left in the range.  Thus only stop the writeback for WB_SYNC_NONE
if nr_to_write hits 0.

This is a port of write_cache_pages changes in commit 05fe478dd04e
("mm: write_cache_pages integrity fix").

Note that I've only trigger the problem with other changes to the btrfs
writeback code, but this condition seems worthwhile fixing anyway.

Subject: [PATCH 3/9] btrfs: don't wait for writeback on clean pages in
 extent_write_cache_pages

__extent_writepage could have started on more pages than the one it was
called for.  This happens regularly for zoned file systems, and in theory
could happen for compressed I/O if the worker thread was executed very
quickly. For such pages extent_write_cache_pages waits for writeback
to complete before moving on to the next page, which is highly inefficient
as it blocks the flusher thread.

Port over the PageDirty check that was added to write_cache_pages in
commit 515f4a037fb ("mm: write_cache_pages optimise page cleaning") to
fix this.

Subject: [PATCH 4/9] btrfs: improve error message after failure to add delayed
 dir index item

If we fail to add a delayed dir index item because there's already another
item with the same index number, we print an error message (and then BUG).
However that message isn't very helpful to debug anything because we don't
know what's the index number and what are the values of index counters in
the inode and its delayed inode (index_cnt fields of struct btrfs_inode
and struct btrfs_delayed_node).

So update the error message to include the index number and counters.

We actually had a recent case where this issue was hit by a syzbot report
(see the link below).

Subject: [PATCH 5/9] btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir
 index item

Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item
into the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we
have allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is
fine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before
calling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
snapshots in the transaction commit path).

So remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.

This relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it because
it only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehow
we attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.

When removing a delayed item, or releasing which will remove it as well,
we will modify one of the delayed node's rbtrees and item counter if the
delayed item is in one of the rbtrees. This require having the delayed
node's mutex locked, otherwise we will race with other tasks modifying
the rbtrees and the counter.

This is motivated by a previous version of another patch actually calling
btrfs_release_delayed_item() after unlocking the delayed node's mutex and
against a delayed item that is in a rbtree.

So assert at __btrfs_remove_delayed_item() that the delayed node's mutex
is locked.

Subject: [PATCH 7/9] btrfs: update comment for reservation of metadata space
 for delayed items

The second comment at btrfs_delayed_item_reserve_metadata() refers to a
field named "index_items_size" of a delayed inode, however that field
does not exists - it existed in a previous patch version, but then it
split into the fields "curr_index_batch_size" and "index_item_leaves"
in the final patch version that was picked. So update the comment.

Subject: [PATCH 8/9] btrfs: set last dir index to the current last index when
 opening dir

When opening a directory for reading it, we set the last index where we
stop iteration to the value in struct btrfs_inode::index_cnt. That value
does not match the index of the most recently added directory entry but
it's instead the index number that will be assigned the next directory
entry.

This means that if after the call to opendir(3) new directory entries are
added, a readdir(3) call will return the first new directory entry. This
is fine because POSIX says the following [1]:

  "If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the most
   recent call to opendir() or rewinddir(), whether a subsequent call to
   readdir() returns an entry for that file is unspecified."

For example for the test script from commit 9b378f6ad48c ("btrfs: fix
infinite directory reads"), where we have 2000 files in a directory, ext4
doesn't return any new directory entry after opendir(3), while xfs returns
the first 13 new directory entries added after the opendir(3) call.

If we move to a shorter example with an empty directory when opendir(3) is
called, and 2 files added to the directory after the opendir(3) call, then
readdir(3) on btrfs will return the first file, ext4 and xfs return the 2
files (but in a different order). A test program for this, reported by
Ian Johnson, is the following:

   #include <dirent.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(void) {
     DIR *dir = opendir("test");

     FILE *file;
     file = fopen("test/1", "w");
     fwrite("1", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     file = fopen("test/2", "w");
     fwrite("2", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     struct dirent *entry;
     while ((entry = readdir(dir))) {
        printf("%s\n", entry->d_name);
     }
     closedir(dir);
     return 0;
   }

To make this less odd, change the behaviour to never return new entries
that were added after the opendir(3) call. This is done by setting the
last_index field of the struct btrfs_file_private attached to the
directory's file handle with a value matching btrfs_inode::index_cnt
minus 1, since that value always matches the index of the next new
directory entry and not the index of the most recently added entry.

Subject: [PATCH 9/9] btrfs: refresh dir last index during a rewinddir(3) call

When opening a directory we find what's the index of its last entry and
then store it in the directory's file handle private data (struct
btrfs_file_private::last_index), so that in the case new directory entries
are added to a directory after an opendir(3) call we don't end up in an
infinite loop (see commit 9b378f6ad48c ("btrfs: fix infinite directory
reads")) when calling readdir(3).

However once rewinddir(3) is called, POSIX states [1] that any new
directory entries added after the previous opendir(3) call, must be
returned by subsequent calls to readdir(3):

  "The rewinddir() function shall reset the position of the directory
   stream to which dirp refers to the beginning of the directory.
   It shall also cause the directory stream to refer to the current
   state of the corresponding directory, as a call to opendir() would
   have done."

We currently don't refresh the last_index field of the struct
btrfs_file_private associated to the directory, so after a rewinddir(3)
we are not returning any new entries added after the opendir(3) call.

Fix this by finding the current last index of the directory when llseek
is called agains the directory.

This can be reproduced by the following C program provided by Ian Johnson:

   #include <dirent.h>
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(void) {
     DIR *dir = opendir("test");

     FILE *file;
     file = fopen("test/1", "w");
     fwrite("1", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     file = fopen("test/2", "w");
     fwrite("2", 1, 1, file);
     fclose(file);

     rewinddir(dir);

     struct dirent *entry;
     while ((entry = readdir(dir))) {
        printf("%s\n", entry->d_name);
     }
     closedir(dir);
     return 0;
   }
