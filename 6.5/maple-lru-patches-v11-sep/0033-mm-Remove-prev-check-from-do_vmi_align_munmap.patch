Subject: [PATCH 33/65] mm: Remove prev check from do_vmi_align_munmap()

If the prev does not exist, the vma iterator will be set to MAS_NONE,
which will be treated as a MAS_START when the mas_next or mas_find is
used.  In this case, the next caller will be the vma iterator, which
uses mas_find() under the hood and will now do what the user expects.
