Subject: [PATCH 1/6] btrfs: wait on uncached block groups on every allocation
 loop

My initial fix for the generic/475 hangs was related to metadata, but
our CI testing uncovered another case where we hang for similar reasons.
We again have a task with a plug that is holding an outstanding request
that is keeping the dm device from finishing it's suspend, and that task
is stuck in the allocator.

This time it is stuck trying to allocate data, but we do not have a
block group that matches the size class.  The larger loop in the
allocator looks like this (simplified of course)

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

In my earlier fix we were trying to allocate from the block group, but
we weren't waiting for the progress because we were only waiting for the
free space to be >= the amount of free space we wanted.  My fix made it
so we waited for forward progress to be made as well, so we would be
sure to wait.

This time however we did not have a block group that matched our size
class, so what was happening was this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

The size_class_doesn't_match() part was true, so we'd just skip this
block group and never wait for caching, and then because we found a
caching block group we'd just go back and do the loop again.  We never
sleep and thus never flush the plug and we have the same deadlock.

Fix the logic for waiting on the block group caching to instead do it
unconditionally when we goto loop.  This takes the logic out of the
allocation step, so now the loop looks more like this

find_free_extent
  for_each_block_group {
    ffe_ctl->cached == btrfs_block_group_cache_done(bg)
    if (!ffe_ctl->cached)
      ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg = true;
    if (size_class_doesn't_match())
      goto loop;
    do_allocation()
      btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
loop:
    if (loop > LOOP_CACHING_NOWAIT && !ffe_ctl->retry_uncached &&
        !ffe_ctl->cached) {
       ffe_ctl->retry_uncached = true;
       btrfs_wait_block_group_cache_progress();
    }

    release_block_group(block_group);
  }

  if (loop == LOOP_CACHING_WAIT && ffe_ctl->have_caching_bg)
    go search again;

This simplifies the logic a lot, and makes sure that if we're hitting
uncached block groups we're always waiting on them at some point.

I ran this through 100 iterations of generic/475, as this particular
case was harder to hit than the previous one.

Subject: [PATCH 2/6] btrfs: don't stop integrity writeback too early

extent_write_cache_pages stops writing pages as soon as nr_to_write hits
zero.  That is the right thing for opportunistic writeback, but incorrect
for data integrity writeback, which needs to ensure that no dirty pages
are left in the range.  Thus only stop the writeback for WB_SYNC_NONE
if nr_to_write hits 0.

This is a port of write_cache_pages changes in commit 05fe478dd04e
("mm: write_cache_pages integrity fix").

Note that I've only trigger the problem with other changes to the btrfs
writeback code, but this condition seems worthwhile fixing anyway.

Subject: [PATCH 3/6] btrfs: don't wait for writeback on clean pages in
 extent_write_cache_pages

__extent_writepage could have started on more pages than the one it was
called for.  This happens regularly for zoned file systems, and in theory
could happen for compressed I/O if the worker thread was executed very
quickly. For such pages extent_write_cache_pages waits for writeback
to complete before moving on to the next page, which is highly inefficient
as it blocks the flusher thread.

Port over the PageDirty check that was added to write_cache_pages in
commit 515f4a037fb ("mm: write_cache_pages optimise page cleaning") to
fix this.

The second comment at btrfs_delayed_item_reserve_metadata() refers to a
field named "index_items_size" of a delayed inode, however that field
does not exists - it existed in a previous patch version, but then it
split into the fields "curr_index_batch_size" and "index_item_leaves"
in the final patch version that was picked. So update the comment.

Subject: [PATCH 5/6] btrfs: adjust overcommit logic when very close to full

A user reported some unpleasant behavior with very small file systems.
The reproducer is this

mkfs.btrfs -f -m single -b 8g /dev/vdb
mount /dev/vdb /mnt/test
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/testfile bs=512M count=20

This will result in usage that looks like this

Overall:
    Device size:                   8.00GiB
    Device allocated:              8.00GiB
    Device unallocated:            1.00MiB
    Device missing:                  0.00B
    Device slack:                  2.00GiB
    Used:                          5.47GiB
    Free (estimated):              2.52GiB      (min: 2.52GiB)
    Free (statfs, df):               0.00B
    Data ratio:                       1.00
    Metadata ratio:                   1.00
    Global reserve:                5.50MiB      (used: 0.00B)
    Multiple profiles:                  no

Data,single: Size:7.99GiB, Used:5.46GiB (68.41%)
   /dev/vdb        7.99GiB

Metadata,single: Size:8.00MiB, Used:5.77MiB (72.07%)
   /dev/vdb        8.00MiB

System,single: Size:4.00MiB, Used:16.00KiB (0.39%)
   /dev/vdb        4.00MiB

Unallocated:
   /dev/vdb        1.00MiB

As you can see we've gotten ourselves quite full with metadata, with all
of the disk being allocated for data.

On smaller file systems there's not a lot of time before we get full, so
our overcommit behavior bites us here.  Generally speaking data
reservations result in chunk allocations as we assume reservation ==
actual use for data.  This means at any point we could end up with a
chunk allocation for data, and if we're very close to full we could do
this before we have a chance to figure out that we need another metadata
chunk.

Address this by adjusting the overcommit logic.  Simply put we need to
take away 1 chunk from the available chunk space in case of a data
reservation.  This will allow us to stop overcommitting before we
potentially lose this space to a data allocation.  With this fix in
place we properly allocate a metadata chunk before we're completely
full, allowing for enough slack space in metadata.

Subject: [PATCH 6/6] btrfs: don't arbitrarily slow down delalloc if we're
 committing

We have a random schedule_timeout() if the current transaction is
committing, which seems to be a holdover from the original delalloc
reservation code.

Remove this, we have the proper flushing stuff, we shouldn't be hoping
for random timing things to make everything work.  This just induces
latency for no reason.
