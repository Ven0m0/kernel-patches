Subject: [PATCH 7/8] loop: don't require ->write_iter for writable files in
 loop_configure

Block devices can be opened read-write even if they can't be written to
for historic reasons.  Remove the check requiring file->f_op->write_iter
when the block devices was opened in loop_configure. The call to
loop_check_backing_file just below ensures the ->write_iter is present
for backing files opened for writing, which is the only check that is
actually needed.

Fixes: f5c84eff634b ("loop: Add sanity check for read/write_iter")
