Subject: [PATCH 5/6] drm/syncobj: Add a fast path to
 drm_syncobj_array_wait_timeout
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Running the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark we can observe that waiting on DRM
sycobjs is relatively hot, but the 96% of the calls are for a single
object. (~4% for two points, and never more than three points. While
a more trivial workload like vkmark under Plasma is even more skewed
to single point waits.)

Therefore lets add a fast path to bypass the kcalloc/kfree and use a pre-
allocated stack array for those cases.
