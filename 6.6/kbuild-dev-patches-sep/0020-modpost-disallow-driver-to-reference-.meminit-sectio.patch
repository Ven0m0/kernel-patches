Subject: [PATCH 20/30] modpost: disallow *driver to reference .meminit*
 sections

Drivers must not reference .meminit* sections, which are discarded
when CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG=n.

The reason for whitelisting "*driver" in the section mismatch check
was to allow drivers to reference symbols annotated as __devinit or
__devexit that existed in the past.

Those annotations were removed by the following commits:

 - 54b956b90360 ("Remove __dev* markings from init.h")
 - 92e9e6d1f984 ("modpost.c: Stop checking __dev* section mismatches")

Remove the stale whitelist.
