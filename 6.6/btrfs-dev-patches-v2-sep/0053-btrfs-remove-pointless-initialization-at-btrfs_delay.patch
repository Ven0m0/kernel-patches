Subject: [PATCH 053/155] btrfs: remove pointless initialization at
 btrfs_delayed_refs_rsv_release()

There's no point in initializing to 0 the local variable 'released' as
we don't use it before the next assignment to it. So remove the
initialization. This may help avoid some warnings with clang tools such
as the one reported/fixed by commit 966de47ff0c9 ("btrfs: remove redundant
initialization of variables in log_new_ancestors").
