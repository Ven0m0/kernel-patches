Subject: [PATCH 22/28] modpost: disallow the combination of EXPORT_SYMBOL and
 __meminit*

Theoretically, we could export conditionally-discarded code sections,
such as .meminit*, if all the users can become modular under a certain
condition. However, that would be difficult to control and such a tricky
case has never occurred.
