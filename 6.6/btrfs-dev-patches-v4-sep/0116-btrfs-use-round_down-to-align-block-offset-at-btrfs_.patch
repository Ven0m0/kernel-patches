Subject: [PATCH 116/152] btrfs: use round_down() to align block offset at
 btrfs_cow_block()

At btrfs_cow_block() we can use round_down() to align the extent buffer's
logical offset to the start offset of a metadata block group, instead of
the less easy to read set of bitwise operations (two plus one subtraction).
So replace the bitwise operations with a round_down() call.
