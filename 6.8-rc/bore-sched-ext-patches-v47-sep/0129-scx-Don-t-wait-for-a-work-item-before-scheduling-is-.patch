Subject: [PATCH 129/167] scx: Don't wait for a work item before scheduling is
 restored in scx_ops_disable_workfn()

When scx_ops_disable_workfn() invoked to disable a BPF scheduler, it cannot
depend on the scheduler working and thus can't depend on !RT tasks making
forward progress, so it performs a series of non-blocking operations to
restore forward progress guarantee and then kicks out the BPF scheduler.

Watchdog code added cancel_delayed_work_sync() in scx_ops_disable_workfn()
before forward progress guarantee is restored. cancel_delayed_work_sync()
implies flush_work() if the target work item is already executing and that
work item may not be able to run due to malfunctioning scheduling, making
the system stuck and unrecoverable.

There's no need to shutdown the watchdog timer early. Move
cancel_delayed_work_sync() to later in the disable process where all the
critical operaitons are complete and the kernel default scheduling is
restored.
