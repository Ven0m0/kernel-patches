Subject: [PATCH 12/14] drm: panel-orientation-quirks: Add quirk for AYA NEO
 GEEK
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add quirk orientation for AYA NEO GEEK. One of the more recent devices by
the brand. The name appears without spaces in dmi strings. The board
name is completely different to the previous models making it difficult
to reuse their quirks despite being the same resolution and mounting.

Tested by the JELOS team that has been patching their own kernel for a
while now and confirmed by users in the AYA NEO and ChimeraOS discord
servers.
