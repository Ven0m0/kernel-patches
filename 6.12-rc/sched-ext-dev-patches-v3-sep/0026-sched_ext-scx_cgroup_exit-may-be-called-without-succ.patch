Subject: [PATCH 26/26] sched_ext: scx_cgroup_exit() may be called without
 successful scx_cgroup_init()

568894edbe48 ("sched_ext: Add scx_cgroup_enabled to gate cgroup operations
and fix scx_tg_online()") assumed that scx_cgroup_exit() is only called
after scx_cgroup_init() finished successfully. This isn't true.
scx_cgroup_exit() can be called without scx_cgroup_init() being called at
all or after scx_cgroup_init() failed in the middle.

As init state is tracked per cgroup, scx_cgroup_exit() can be used safely to
clean up in all cases. Remove the incorrect WARN_ON_ONCE().
