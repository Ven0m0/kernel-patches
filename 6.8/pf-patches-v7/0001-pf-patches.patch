Subject: [PATCH 01/12] btrfs: document what the spinlock unused_bgs_lock
 protects

Add some comments to struct btrfs_fs_info to explicitly document which
members are protected by the spinlock unused_bgs_lock. It is currently
used to protect two linked lists, the reclaim_bgs and unused_bgs lists.

So add an explicit comment on top of each list to mention its protected
by unused_bgs_lock, as well as comment on top of unused_bgs_lock to
mention the lists it protects.

Subject: [PATCH 02/12] btrfs: add comment about list_is_singular() use at
 btrfs_delete_unused_bgs()

At btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), the use of the list_is_singular() check on
a block group may not be immediately obvious. It is there to prevent
losing raid profile information for a block group type (data, metadata or
system), as that information is removed from
fs_info->avail_[data|metadata|system]_alloc_bits when the last block group
of a given type is deleted. So deleting the block group would later result
in creating block groups of that type with a single profile (because
fs_info->avail_*_alloc_bits would have a value of 0).

This check was added in commit aefbe9a633b5 ("btrfs: Fix lost-data-profile
caused by auto removing bg").

So add a comment mentioning the need for the check.

Subject: [PATCH 03/12] btrfs: Fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()

To prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,
read_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:

    /* (1) */
    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))
        return 0;

    /* (2) */
    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))
        goto done;

At this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once
that completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does

    /* (3) */
    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);

    /* (4) */
    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);

Normally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other
callers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is
a racey interleaving:

    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C
    ---------+----------+---------
       (1)   |          |
             |    (1)   |
       (2)   |          |
       (3)   |          |
       (4)   |          |
             |    (2)   |
             |          |    (1)

When this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread
C will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from
thread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker
errors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:

    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256
    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356
    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]

Fix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and if
it's been set, skip the unnecessary read.

Subject: [PATCH 05/12] btrfs: WARN if EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE is set while
 reading

We recently tracked down a race condition that triggered a read for an
extent buffer with EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE already set.  While this read
was in progress, other concurrent readers would see the UPTODATE bit and
return early as if the read was already complete, making accesses to the
extent buffer conflict with the read operation that was overwriting it.

Add a WARN_ON() to end_bbio_meta_read() for this situation to make
similar races easier to spot in the future.

Subject: [PATCH 06/12] md/raid5: fix deadlock between md0_reclaim and
 md0_raid5

Commit 5e2cf333b7bd ("md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d") introduced a regression, it got reverted through commit
bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d"). To fix the original issue commit 5e2cf333b7bd was fixing,
commit d6e035aad6c0 ("md: bypass block throttle for superblock update")
was created, it avoids md superblock write getting throttled by block
layer which is good, but md superblock write could be stuck in block
layer due to block flush as well, and that is what was happening in this
regression report.

Process "md0_reclaim" got stuck while waiting IO for md superblock write
done, that IO was marked with REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA flags, these 3
steps ( PREFLUSH, DATA and POSTFLUSH ) will be executed before done, the
hung of this process is because the last step "POSTFLUSH" never done.
And that was because of  process "md0_raid5" submitted another IO with
REQ_FUA flag marked just before that step started. To handle that IO,
blk_insert_flush() will be invoked and hit "REQ_FSEQ_DATA |
REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH" case where "fq->flush_data_in_flight" will be
increased. When the IO for md superblock write was to issue "POSTFLUSH"
step through blk_kick_flush(), it found that "fq->flush_data_in_flight"
was not zero, so it will skip that step, that is expected, because flush
will be triggered when "fq->flush_data_in_flight" dropped to zero.

Unfortunately here that inflight data IO from "md0_raid5" will never
done, because it was added into the blk_plug list of that process, but
"md0_raid5" run into infinite loop due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" which
made it never had a chance to finish the blk plug until
"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" was cleared. Process "md0_reclaim" was supposed
to clear that flag but it was stuck by "md0_raid5", so this is a deadlock.

Once "md0_raid5" starts looping due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING", it should
release all its staging IO requests to avoid blocking others.

Subject: [PATCH 07/12] raid1: fix use-after-free for original bio in
 raid1_write_request()

r1_bio->bios[] is used to record new bios that will be issued to
underlying disks, however, in raid1_write_request(), r1_bio->bios[]
will set to the original bio temporarily. Meanwhile, if blocked rdev
is set, free_r1bio() will be called causing that all r1_bio->bios[]
to be freed:

raid1_write_request()
 r1_bio = alloc_r1bio(mddev, bio); -> r1_bio->bios[] is NULL
 for (i = 0;  i < disks; i++) -> for each rdev in conf
  // first rdev is normal
  r1_bio->bios[0] = bio; -> set to original bio
  // second rdev is blocked
  if (test_bit(Blocked, &rdev->flags))
   break

 if (blocked_rdev)
  free_r1bio()
   put_all_bios()
    bio_put(r1_bio->bios[0]) -> original bio is freed

Test scripts:

mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n4 /dev/sd[abcd] --assume-clean

Reinstate commit 88b065943cb5 ("drm/i915/dsi: Do display on

machines (eg. Chuwi Minibook X) really do need that updated order.
It is also the order the Windows driver uses.

However we can't just undo the revert since that would again
break Lenovo 82TQ. After staring at the VBT sequences for both
machines I've concluded that the Lenovo 82TQ sequences look
somewhat broken:
 - INIT_OTP is not present at all
 - what should be in INIT_OTP is found in DISPLAY_ON
 - what should be in DISPLAY_ON is found in BACKLIGHT_ON
   (along with the actual backlight stuff)

The Chuwi Minibook X on the other hand has a full complement
of sequences in its VBT.

So let's try to deal with the broken sequences in the
Lenovo 82TQ VBT by simply swapping the (non-existent)
INIT_OTP sequence with the DISPLAY_ON sequence. Thus we
execute DISPLAY_ON when intending to execute INIT_OTP,
and execute nothing at all when intending to execute
DISPLAY_ON. That should be 100% equivalent to the
revert, for such broken VBTs.

Subject: [PATCH 10/12] btrfs: reuse cloned extent buffer during fiemap to
 avoid re-allocations

During fiemap we may have to visit multiples leaves of the subvolume's
inode tree, and each time we are freeing and allocating an extent buffer
to use as a clone of each visited leaf. Optimize this by reusing cloned
extent buffers, to avoid the freeing and re-allocation both of the extent
buffer structure itself and more importantly of the pages attached to the
extent buffer.

Subject: [PATCH 11/12] btrfs: do not skip re-registration for the mounted
 device

There are reports that since version 6.7 update-grub fails to find the
device of the root on systems without initrd and on a single device.

This looks like the device name changed in the output of
/proc/self/mountinfo:

6.5-rc5 working

  18 1 0:16 / / rw,noatime - btrfs /dev/sda8 ...

6.7 not working:

  17 1 0:15 / / rw,noatime - btrfs /dev/root ...

and "update-grub" shows this error:

  /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?)

This looks like it's related to the device name, but grub-probe
recognizes the "/dev/root" path and tries to find the underlying device.
However there's a special case for some filesystems, for btrfs in
particular.

The generic root device detection heuristic is not done and it all
relies on reading the device infos by a btrfs specific ioctl. This ioctl
returns the device name as it was saved at the time of device scan (in
this case it's /dev/root).

The change in 6.7 for temp_fsid to allow several single device
filesystem to exist with the same fsid (and transparently generate a new
UUID at mount time) was to skip caching/registering such devices.

This also skipped mounted device. One step of scanning is to check if
the device name hasn't changed, and if yes then update the cached value.

This broke the grub-probe as it always read the device /dev/root and
couldn't find it in the system. A temporary workaround is to create a
symlink but this does not survive reboot.

The right fix is to allow updating the device path of a mounted
filesystem even if this is a single device one.

In the fix, check if the device's major:minor number matches with the
cached device. If they do, then we can allow the scan to happen so that
device_list_add() can take care of updating the device path. The file
descriptor remains unchanged.

This does not affect the temp_fsid feature, the UUID of the mounted
filesystem remains the same and the matching is based on device major:minor
which is unique per mounted filesystem.

This covers the path when the device (that exists for all mounted
devices) name changes, updating /dev/root to /dev/sdx. Any other single
device with filesystem and is not mounted is still skipped.

Note that if a system is booted and initial mount is done on the
/dev/root device, this will be the cached name of the device. Only after
the command "btrfs device scan" it will change as it triggers the
rename.

The fix was verified by users whose systems were affected.
