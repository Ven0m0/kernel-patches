Subject: [PATCH 18/37] Documentation: cpufreq: amd-pstate: introduce the new
 cpu boost control method

Introduce AMD CPU frequency boosting control sysfs entry which used for
switching boost on and boost off.

If core performance boost is disabled while a core is in a boosted P-state,
the core automatically transitions to the highest performance non-boosted P-state
The highest perf and frequency will be limited by the setting value.
