Subject: [PATCH 32/40] x86/cpufeatures: Add feature bits for AMD heterogeneous
 processor

CPUID leaf 0x80000026 advertises core types with different efficiency rankings

Bit 30 indicates the heterogeneous core topology feature, if the bit
set, it means not all instances at the current hierarchical level have
the same core topology.

For better utilization of feature words and help to identify core type,
X86_FEATURE_HETERO_CORE_TOPOLOGY is added as a few scattered feature bits.
