Subject: [PATCH 1/4] btrfs: New helper to clear EXTENT_BUFFER_READING

We are clearing the bit and waking up any waiters in two different
places.  Factor that code out into a static helper function.

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] btrfs: WARN if EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE is set while
 reading

We recently tracked down a race condition that triggered a read for an
extent buffer with EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE already set.  While this read
was in progress, other concurrent readers would see the UPTODATE bit and
return early as if the read was already complete, making accesses to the
extent buffer conflict with the read operation that was overwriting it.

Add a WARN_ON() to end_bbio_meta_read() for this situation to make
similar races easier to spot in the future.

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] md/raid5: fix deadlock between md0_reclaim and md0_raid5

Commit 5e2cf333b7bd ("md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d") introduced a regression, it got reverted through commit
bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d"). To fix the original issue commit 5e2cf333b7bd was fixing,
commit d6e035aad6c0 ("md: bypass block throttle for superblock update")
was created, it avoids md superblock write getting throttled by block
layer which is good, but md superblock write could be stuck in block
layer due to block flush as well, and that is what was happening in this
regression report.

Process "md0_reclaim" got stuck while waiting IO for md superblock write
done, that IO was marked with REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA flags, these 3
steps ( PREFLUSH, DATA and POSTFLUSH ) will be executed before done, the
hung of this process is because the last step "POSTFLUSH" never done.
And that was because of  process "md0_raid5" submitted another IO with
REQ_FUA flag marked just before that step started. To handle that IO,
blk_insert_flush() will be invoked and hit "REQ_FSEQ_DATA |
REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH" case where "fq->flush_data_in_flight" will be
increased. When the IO for md superblock write was to issue "POSTFLUSH"
step through blk_kick_flush(), it found that "fq->flush_data_in_flight"
was not zero, so it will skip that step, that is expected, because flush
will be triggered when "fq->flush_data_in_flight" dropped to zero.

Unfortunately here that inflight data IO from "md0_raid5" will never
done, because it was added into the blk_plug list of that process, but
"md0_raid5" run into infinite loop due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" which
made it never had a chance to finish the blk plug until
"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" was cleared. Process "md0_reclaim" was supposed
to clear that flag but it was stuck by "md0_raid5", so this is a deadlock.

Once "md0_raid5" starts looping due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING", it should
release all its staging IO requests to avoid blocking others.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] raid1: fix use-after-free for original bio in
 raid1_write_request()

r1_bio->bios[] is used to record new bios that will be issued to
underlying disks, however, in raid1_write_request(), r1_bio->bios[]
will set to the original bio temporarily. Meanwhile, if blocked rdev
is set, free_r1bio() will be called causing that all r1_bio->bios[]
to be freed:

raid1_write_request()
 r1_bio = alloc_r1bio(mddev, bio); -> r1_bio->bios[] is NULL
 for (i = 0;  i < disks; i++) -> for each rdev in conf
  // first rdev is normal
  r1_bio->bios[0] = bio; -> set to original bio
  // second rdev is blocked
  if (test_bit(Blocked, &rdev->flags))
   break

 if (blocked_rdev)
  free_r1bio()
   put_all_bios()
    bio_put(r1_bio->bios[0]) -> original bio is freed

Test scripts:

mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n4 /dev/sd[abcd] --assume-clean
fio -filename=/dev/md0 -ioengine=libaio -rw=write -bs=4k -numjobs=1 \
    -iodepth=128 -name=test -direct=1
echo blocked > /sys/block/md0/md/rd2/state

Since that bios for underlying disks are not allocated yet, fix this
problem by using mempool_free() directly to free the r1_bio.
