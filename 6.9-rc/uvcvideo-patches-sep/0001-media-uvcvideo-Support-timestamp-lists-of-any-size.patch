Subject: [PATCH 1/7] media: uvcvideo: Support timestamp lists of any size

The tail of the list lives at the position before the head. This is
mathematically noted as:
```
(head-1) mod size.
```
Unfortunately C, does not have a modulus operator, but a remainder
operator (%).
The reminder operation has a different result than the modulus if
(head -1) is a negative number and size is not a power of two.

Adding size to (head-1) allows the code to run with any value of size.

This does not change the current behaviour of the driver, as the size is
always a power of two, but avoid tedious debugging if we ever change its
size.
