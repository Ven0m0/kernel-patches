Subject: [PATCH 3/3] mmap: Add clarifying comment to vma_merge() code

When tracing through the code in vma_merge(), it was not completely
clear why the error return to a dup_anon_vma() call would not overwrite
a previous attempt to the same function.  This commit adds a comment
specifying why it is safe.
