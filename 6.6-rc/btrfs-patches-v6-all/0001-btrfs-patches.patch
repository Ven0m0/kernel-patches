Subject: [PATCH 1/4] btrfs: don't stop integrity writeback too early

extent_write_cache_pages stops writing pages as soon as nr_to_write hits
zero.  That is the right thing for opportunistic writeback, but incorrect
for data integrity writeback, which needs to ensure that no dirty pages
are left in the range.  Thus only stop the writeback for WB_SYNC_NONE
if nr_to_write hits 0.

This is a port of write_cache_pages changes in commit 05fe478dd04e
("mm: write_cache_pages integrity fix").

Note that I've only trigger the problem with other changes to the btrfs
writeback code, but this condition seems worthwhile fixing anyway.

Subject: [PATCH 2/4] btrfs: don't wait for writeback on clean pages in
 extent_write_cache_pages

__extent_writepage could have started on more pages than the one it was
called for.  This happens regularly for zoned file systems, and in theory
could happen for compressed I/O if the worker thread was executed very
quickly. For such pages extent_write_cache_pages waits for writeback
to complete before moving on to the next page, which is highly inefficient
as it blocks the flusher thread.

Port over the PageDirty check that was added to write_cache_pages in
commit 515f4a037fb ("mm: write_cache_pages optimise page cleaning") to
fix this.

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] btrfs: update comment for reservation of metadata space
 for delayed items

The second comment at btrfs_delayed_item_reserve_metadata() refers to a
field named "index_items_size" of a delayed inode, however that field
does not exists - it existed in a previous patch version, but then it
split into the fields "curr_index_batch_size" and "index_item_leaves"
in the final patch version that was picked. So update the comment.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] btrfs: don't arbitrarily slow down delalloc if we're
 committing

We have a random schedule_timeout() if the current transaction is
committing, which seems to be a holdover from the original delalloc
reservation code.

Remove this, we have the proper flushing stuff, we shouldn't be hoping
for random timing things to make everything work.  This just induces
latency for no reason.
