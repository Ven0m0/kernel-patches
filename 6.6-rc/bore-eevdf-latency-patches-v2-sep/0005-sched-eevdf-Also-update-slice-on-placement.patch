Subject: [PATCH 5/7] sched/eevdf: Also update slice on placement

Tasks that never consume their full slice would not update their slice value.
This means that tasks that are spawned before the sysctl scaling keep their
original (UP) slice length.

Fixes: 147f3efaa241 ("sched/fair: Implement an EEVDF-like scheduling policy")
