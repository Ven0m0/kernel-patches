Subject: [PATCH 45/75] bcachefs: Explicitly select CRYPTO from BCACHEFS_FS

Explicitly select CRYPTO from BCACHEFS_FS, so that this dependency of
CRYPTO_SHA256, CRYPTO_CHACHA20, and CRYPTO_POLY1305 (which are also
selected) is satisfied.  Currently this dependency is satisfied
indirectly via LIBCRC32C, but this is fragile and is planned to change
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241021002935.325878-13-ebiggers@kernel.org).

Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/oe-kbuild-all/202410232254.ogS6Em2d-lkp@intel.com/
