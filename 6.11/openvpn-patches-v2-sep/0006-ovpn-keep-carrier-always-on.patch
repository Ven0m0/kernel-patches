Subject: [PATCH 06/25] ovpn: keep carrier always on

An ovpn interface will keep carrier always on and let the user
decide when an interface should be considered disconnected.

This way, even if an ovpn interface is not connected to any peer,
it can still retain all IPs and routes and thus prevent any data
leak.
