Subject: [PATCH 18/37] mm/mmap: Fix MAP_FIXED address return on VMA merge

mmap should return the start address of newly mapped area when
successful.  On a successful merge of a VMA, the return address was
changed and thus was violating that expectation from userspace.

This is a restoration of functionality provided by 309d08d9b3a3
(mm/mmap.c: fix mmap return value when vma is merged after call_mmap()).
For completeness of fixing MAP_FIXED, implement the comments from the
previous discussion to never update the address and fail if the address
changes.  Leaving the error as a WARN_ON() to avoid crashing the kernel.
