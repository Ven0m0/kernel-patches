Subject: [PATCH 93/98] lib: maple_tree: remove unneeded initialization in
 mtree_range_walk()

Before the do-while loop in mtree_range_walk(), the variables next, min,
max need to be initialized. The variables last, prev_min and prev_max are
set within the loop body before they are eventually used after exiting the
loop body.

As it is a do-while loop, the loop body is executed at least once, so the
variables last, prev_min and prev_max do not need to be initialized before
the loop body.

Remove unneeded initialization of last and prev_min.

The needless initialization was reported by clang-analyzer as Dead Stores.

As the compiler already identifies these assignments as unneeded, it
optimizes the assignments away. Hence:

No functional change. No change in object code.
