Subject: [PATCH 38/56] scripts/mksysmap: Fix badly escaped '$'
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The backslash characters escaping '$' in the command to sed (intended to
prevent it from interpreting '$' as "end-of-line") are currently being
consumed by the Shell (where they mean that sh should not evaluate what
follows '$' as a variable name). This means that

    sed -e "/ \$/d"

executes the script

    / $/d

instead of the intended

    / \$/d

So escape twice in mksysmap any '$' that actually needs to reach sed
escaped so that the backslash survives the Shell.

Fixes: c4802044a0a7 ("scripts/mksysmap: use sed with in-line comments")
Fixes: 320e7c9d4494 ("scripts/kallsyms: move compiler-generated symbol patterns to mksysmap")
