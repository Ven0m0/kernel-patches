Subject: [PATCH 35/37] sched/fair: Consider the idle state of the whole core
 for load balance

should_we_balance() traverses the group_balance_mask (AND'ed with lb_env::
cpus) starting from lower numbered CPUs looking for the first idle CPU.

In hybrid x86 systems, the siblings of SMT cores get CPU numbers, before
non-SMT cores:

	[0, 1] [2, 3] [4, 5] 6 7 8 9
         b  i   b  i   b  i  b i i i

In the figure above, CPUs in brackets are siblings of an SMT core. The
rest are non-SMT cores. 'b' indicates a busy CPU, 'i' indicates an
idle CPU.

We should let a CPU on a fully idle core get the first chance to idle
load balance as it has more CPU capacity than a CPU on an idle SMT
CPU with busy sibling.  So for the figure above, if we are running
should_we_balance() to CPU 1, we should return false to let CPU 7 on
idle core to have a chance first to idle load balance.

A partially busy (i.e., of type group_has_spare) local group with SMT
cores will often have only one SMT sibling busy. If the destination CPU
is a non-SMT core, partially busy, lower-numbered, SMT cores should not
be considered when finding the first idle CPU.

However, in should_we_balance(), when we encounter idle SMT first in partially
busy core, we prematurely break the search for the first idle CPU.

Higher-numbered, non-SMT cores is not given the chance to have
idle balance done on their behalf. Those CPUs will only be considered
for idle balancing by chance via CPU_NEWLY_IDLE.

Instead, consider the idle state of the whole SMT core.
