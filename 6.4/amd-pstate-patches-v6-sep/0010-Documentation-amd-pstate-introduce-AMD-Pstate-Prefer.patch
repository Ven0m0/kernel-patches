+AMD Pstate Preferred Core
+=================================
+
+The core frequency is subjected to the process variation in semiconductors.
+Not all cores are able to reach the maximum frequency respecting the
+infrastructure limits. Consequently, AMD has redefined the concept of
+maximum frequency of a part. This means that a fraction of cores can reach
+maximum frequency. To find the best process scheduling policy for a given
+scenario, OS needs to know the core ordering informed by the platform through
+highest performance capability register of the CPPC interface.
+
+``AMD Pstate Preferred Core`` use ITMT arch provides functions and data structures
+for enabling the scheduler to favor scheduling on cores can be get a higher frequency
+with lower voltage under preferred core. And it has the ability to dynamically
+change the preferred core based on the workload and platform conditions and
+accounting for thermals and aging.
+
+The priority metric will be initialized by the AMD Pstate driver. The AMD Pstate
+driver will also determine whether or not ``AMD Pstate Preferred Core`` is
+supported by the platform.
+
+AMD Pstate driver will provide an initial core ordering when the system boots.
+The platform uses the CPPC interfaces to communicate the core ranking to the
+operating system and scheduler to make sure that OS is choosing the cores
+with highest performance firstly for scheduling the process. When AMD Pstate
+driver receives a message with the highest performance change, it will
+update the core ranking and set the cpu's priority.

+Kernel Parameters
+-----------------
+
+``AMD Pstate Preferred Core`` has two states: enable and disable.
+Enable/disable states can be chosen by different kernel parameters.
+Default disable ``AMD Pstate Preferred Core``.
+
+``amd_prefcore=enable``
+
+If ``amd_prefcore=enable`` is passed to kernel command line option
+then enable ``AMD Pstate Preferred Core`` if the processor and power
+firmware can support preferred core feature.
