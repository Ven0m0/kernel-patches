Subject: [PATCH 26/36] drm/amd/display: mark plane as needing reset if plane
 color mgmt changes

We took a similar path for CRTC color mgmt changes, since we remap CRTC
degamma to plane/DPP block. Here we can use the status of
`plane->color_mgmt_changed` to detect when a plane color property
changed and recreate the plane accordingly.
