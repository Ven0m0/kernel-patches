Subject: [PATCH 09/19] btrfs: improve batch insertion of delayed dir index
 items

Currently we group delayed dir index items for insertion as a single batch
(a single btree operation) as long as their keys are sequential in the key
space.

For example we have delayed index items for the following index keys:

   10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20, 21

We end up building three batches:

1) First one for index keys 10, 11 and 12;
2) Second one for index keys 15 and 16;
3) Third one for index keys 20 and 21.

However, since the dir index numbers come from a monotonically increasing
counter and are never reused, we could group all these items into a single
batch. The existence of holes in the sequence happens only when we had
delayed dir index items for insertion that got deleted before they were
flushed to the subvolume's tree.

The delayed items are stored in a rbtree based on their key order, so
we can just group items into a batch as long as they all fit in a leaf,
and ignore if there's a gap (key offset, index number) between two
consecutive items. This is more efficient and reduces the amount of
time spent when running delayed items if there are gaps between dir
index items.

For example running the following test script:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj

  mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT

  NUM_FILES=100

  mkdir $MNT/testdir
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i++)); do
       echo -n > $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  # Now delete every other file, to create gaps in the dir index keys.
  for ((i = 1; i <= $NUM_FILES; i += 2)); do
      rm -f $MNT/testdir/file_$i
  done

  start=$(date +%s%N)
  sync
  end=$(date +%s%N)
  dur=$(( (end - start) / 1000000 ))

  echo -e "\nsync took $dur milliseconds"

  umount $MNT

While having the following bpftrace script running in another shell:

  $ cat bpf-delayed-items-inserts.sh
  #!/usr/bin/bpftrace

  /* Must add 'noinline' to btrfs_insert_delayed_items(). */
  k:btrfs_insert_delayed_items
  {
      @start_insert_delayed_items[tid] = nsecs;
  }

  k:btrfs_insert_empty_items
  /@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
     @insert_batches = count();
  }

  kr:btrfs_insert_delayed_items
  /@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]/
  {
      $dur = (nsecs - @start_insert_delayed_items[tid]) / 1000;
      @btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time = sum($dur);
      delete(@start_insert_delayed_items[tid]);
  }

Before this change:

@btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time: 576
@insert_batches: 51

After this change:

@btrfs_insert_delayed_items_total_time: 174
@insert_batches: 2
