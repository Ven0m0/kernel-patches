Subject: [PATCH 34/39] scripts/clang-tools: Remove
 DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling check

This `clang-analyzer` check flags the use of memset(), suggesting a more
secure version of the API, such as memset_s(), which does not exist in
the kernel:

  warning: Call to function 'memset' is insecure as it does not provide
  security checks introduced in the C11 standard. Replace with analogous
  functions that support length arguments or provides boundary checks such
  as 'memset_s' in case of C11
  [clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling]
