Subject: [PATCH 5/8] x86: mm: refer to the intended config STRICT_DEVMEM in a
 comment

Commit a4866aa81251 ("mm: Tighten x86 /dev/mem with zeroing reads") adds a
comment to the function devmem_is_allowed() referring to a non-existing
config STRICT_IOMEM, whereas the comment very likely intended to refer to
the config STRICT_DEVMEM, as the commit adds some behavior for the config
STRICT_DEVMEM.

Most of the initial analysis was actually done by Dave Hansen in the
email thread below (see Link).

Refer to the intended and existing config STRICT_DEVMEM.
