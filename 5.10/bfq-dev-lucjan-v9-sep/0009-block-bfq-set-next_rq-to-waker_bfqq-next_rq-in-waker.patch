Subject: [PATCH 09/56] block, bfq: set next_rq to waker_bfqq->next_rq in waker
 injection

Since commit c5089591c3ba ("block, bfq: detect wakers and
unconditionally inject their I/O"), when the in-service bfq_queue, say
Q, is temporarily empty, BFQ checks whether there are I/O requests to
inject (also) from the waker bfq_queue for Q. To this goal, the value
pointed by bfqq->waker_bfqq->next_rq must be controlled. However, the
current implementation mistakenly looks at bfqq->next_rq, which
instead points to the next request of the currently served queue.

This mistake evidently causes losses of throughput in scenarios with
waker bfq_queues.

This commit corrects this mistake.
