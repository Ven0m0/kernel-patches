-Random reboot issues
-====================
-When a random reboot occurs, the high-level reason for the reboot is stored
-in a register that will persist onto the next boot.
-
-There are 6 classes of reasons for the reboot:
- * Software induced
- * Power state transition
- * Pin induced
- * Hardware induced
- * Remote reset
- * Internal CPU event

-This information is read by the kernel at bootup and is saved into the
-kernel ring buffer. When a random reboot occurs this message can be helpful
-to determine the next component to debug such an issue.
