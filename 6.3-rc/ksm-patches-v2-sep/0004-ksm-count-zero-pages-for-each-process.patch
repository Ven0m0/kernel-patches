Subject: [PATCH 4/8] ksm: count zero pages for each process

As the number of ksm zero pages is not included in ksm_merging_pages per
process when enabling use_zero_pages, it's unclear of how many actual
pages are merged by KSM. To let users accurately estimate their memory
demands when unsharing KSM zero-pages, it's necessary to show KSM zero-
pages per process.

since unsharing zero pages placed by KSM accurately is achieved, then
tracking empty pages merging and unmerging is not a difficult thing any
longer.

Since we already have /proc/<pid>/ksm_stat, just add the information of
zero_pages_sharing in it.
