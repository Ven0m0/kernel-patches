Subject: [PATCH 44/46] mm: do not increment pgfault stats when page fault
 handler retries

If the page fault handler requests a retry, we will count the fault
multiple times. This is a relatively harmless problem as the retry paths
are not often requested, and the only user-visible problem is that the
fault counter will be slightly higher than it should be.  Nevertheless,
userspace only took one fault, and should not see the fact that the
kernel had to retry the fault multiple times.
Move page fault accounting into mm_account_fault() and skip incomplete
faults which will be accounted upon completion.

Fixes: d065bd810b6d ("mm: retry page fault when blocking on disk transfer")
