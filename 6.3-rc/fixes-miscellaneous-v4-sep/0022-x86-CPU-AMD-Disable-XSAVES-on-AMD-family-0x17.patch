Subject: [PATCH 22/22] x86/CPU/AMD: Disable XSAVES on AMD family 0x17

AMD Erratum 1386 is summarised as:

  XSAVES Instruction May Fail to Save XMM Registers to the Provided
  State Save Area

This piece of accidental chronomancy causes the %xmm registers to
occasionally reset back to an older value.

Ignore the XSAVES feature on all AMD Zen1/2 hardware.  The XSAVEC
instruction (which works fine) is equivalent on affected parts.

  [ bp: Typos, move it into the F17h-specific function. ]
