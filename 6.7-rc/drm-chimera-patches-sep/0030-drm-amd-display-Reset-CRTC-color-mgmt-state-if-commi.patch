Subject: [PATCH 30/40] drm/amd/display: Reset CRTC color mgmt state if commit
 fails

If we failed our commit, if our new crtc was dirty color-wise, make
sure we forward that dirty bit on our old state now so we don't
forget to revert the work we did before we failed this commit on
the next commit.

Fixes a bug in SteamOS/Gamescope where we could fail a
commit that changed the gamma of the CRTC and it would
persist even after we did a new commit with a different
gamma (as we were doing single plane optimizations
and didn't need degamma + gamma for correct blending)
