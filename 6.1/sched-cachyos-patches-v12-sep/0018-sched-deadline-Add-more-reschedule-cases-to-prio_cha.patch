Subject: [PATCH 18/18] sched/deadline: Add more reschedule cases to
 prio_changed_dl()

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230206140612.701871-1-vschneid@redhat.com/T/#u

I've been tracking down an issue on a ~5.17ish kernel where:

  CPUx                           CPUy

  <DL task p0 owns an rtmutex M>
  <p0 depletes its runtime, gets throttled>
  <rq switches to the idle task>
				 <DL task p1 blocks on M, boost/replenish p0>
				 <No call to resched_curr() happens here>

  [idle task keeps running here until *something*
   accidentally sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED]

On that kernel, it is quite easy to trigger using rt-tests's deadline_test
[1] with the test running on isolated CPUs (this reduces the chance of
something unrelated setting TIF_NEED_RESCHED on the idle tasks, making the
issue even more obvious as the hung task detector chimes in).

I haven't been able to reproduce this using a mainline kernel, even if I
revert

  2972e3050e35 ("tracing: Make trace_marker{,_raw} stream-like")

which gets rid of the lock involved in the above test, *but* I cannot
convince myself the issue isn't there from looking at the code.

Make prio_changed_dl() issue a reschedule if the current task isn't a
deadline one. While at it, ensure a reschedule is emitted when a
queued-but-not-current task gets boosted with an earlier deadline that
current's.
