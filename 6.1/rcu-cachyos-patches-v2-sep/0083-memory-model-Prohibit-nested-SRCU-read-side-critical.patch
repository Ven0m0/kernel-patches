Subject: [PATCH 83/89] memory-model: Prohibit nested SRCU read-side critical
 sections

This commit prohibits nested SRCU read-side critical sections of the
same srcu_struct structure.  The memory model does not currently handle
these correctly because it ignores the required connection between
srcu_read_lock() and srcu_read_unlock() provided by the value returned
from the former and passed into the latter.
