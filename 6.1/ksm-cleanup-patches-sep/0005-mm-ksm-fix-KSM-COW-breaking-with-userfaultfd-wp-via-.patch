Subject: [PATCH 5/9] mm/ksm: fix KSM COW breaking with userfaultfd-wp via
 FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE

Let's stop breaking COW via a fake write fault and let's use
FAULT_FLAG_UNSHARE instead. This avoids any wrong side effects of the fake
write fault, such as mapping the PTE writable and marking the pte
dirty/softdirty.

Consequently, we will no longer trigger a fake write fault and break COW
without any such side-effects.

Also, this fixes KSM interaction with userfaultfd-wp: when we have a KSM
page that's write-protected by userfaultfd, break_ksm()->handle_mm_fault()
will fail with VM_FAULT_SIGBUS and will simply return in break_ksm() with
0 instead of actually breaking COW.

For now, the KSM unmerge tests can trigger that:
    $ sudo ./ksm_functional_tests
    TAP version 13
    1..3
    # [RUN] test_unmerge
    ok 1 Pages were unmerged
    # [RUN] test_unmerge_discarded
    ok 2 Pages were unmerged
    # [RUN] test_unmerge_uffd_wp
    not ok 3 Pages were unmerged
    Bail out! 1 out of 3 tests failed
    # Planned tests != run tests (2 != 3)
    # Totals: pass:2 fail:1 xfail:0 xpass:0 skip:0 error:0

The warning in dmesg also indicates this wrong handling:

This is primarily a fix for KSM+userfaultfd-wp, however, the fake write
fault was always questionable. As this fix is not easy to backport and it's
not very critical, let's not cc stable.
