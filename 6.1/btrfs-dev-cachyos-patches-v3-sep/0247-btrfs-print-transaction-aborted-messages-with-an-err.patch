Subject: [PATCH 247/247] btrfs: print transaction aborted messages with an
 error level

Currently we print the transaction aborted message with a debug level, but
a transaction abort is an exceptional event that indicates something went
wrong and it's useful to have it printed with an error level as it helps
analysing problems in a production environment, where debug level messages
are typically not logged. For example reports from syzbot never include
the transaction aborted message, since the log level on the test machines
is above the debug level.

So change the log level from debug to error.
