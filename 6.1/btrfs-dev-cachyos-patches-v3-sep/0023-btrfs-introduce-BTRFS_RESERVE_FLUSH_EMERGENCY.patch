Subject: [PATCH 023/247] btrfs: introduce BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_EMERGENCY

Inside of FB, as well as some user reports, we've had a consistent
problem of occasional ENOSPC transaction aborts.  Inside FB we were
seeing ~100-200 ENOSPC aborts per day in the fleet, which is a really
low occurrence rate given the size of our fleet, but it's not nothing.

There are two causes of this particular problem.

First is delayed allocation.  The reservation system for delalloc
assumes that contiguous dirty ranges will result in 1 file extent item.
However if there is memory pressure that results in fragmented writeout,
or there is fragmentation in the block groups, this won't necessarily be
true.  Consider the case where we do a single 256MiB write to a file and
then close it.  We will have 1 reservation for the inode update, the
reservations for the checksum updates, and 1 reservation for the file
extent item.  At some point later we decide to write this entire range
out, but we're so fragmented that we break this into 100 different file
extents.  Since we've already closed the file and are no longer writing
to it there's nothing to trigger a refill of the delalloc block rsv to
satisfy the 99 new file extent reservations we need.  At this point we
exhaust our delalloc reservation, and we begin to steal from the global
reserve.  If you have enough of these cases going in parallel you can
easily exhaust the global reserve, get an ENOSPC at
btrfs_alloc_tree_block() time, and then abort the transaction.

The other case is the delayed refs reserve.  The delayed refs reserve
updates its size based on outstanding delayed refs and dirty block
groups.  However we only refill this block reserve when returning
excess reservations and when we call btrfs_start_transaction(root, X).
We will reserve 2*X credits at transaction start time, and fill in X
into the delayed refs reserve to make sure it stays topped off.
Generally this works well, but clearly has downsides.  If we do a
particularly delayed ref heavy operation we may never catch up in our
reservations.  Additionally running delayed refs generates more delayed
refs, and at that point we may be committing the transaction and have no
way to trigger a refill of our delayed refs rsv.  Then a similar thing
occurs with the delalloc reserve.

Generally speaking we well over-reserve in all of our block rsvs.  If we
reserve 1 credit we're usually reserving around 264k of space, but we'll
often not use any of that reservation, or use a few blocks of that
reservation.  We can be reasonably sure that as long as you were able to
reserve space up front for your operation you'll be able to find space
on disk for that reservation.

So introduce a new flushing state, BTRFS_RESERVE_FLUSH_EMERGENCY.  This
gets used in the case that we've exhausted our reserve and the global
reserve.  It simply forces a reservation if we have enough actual space
on disk to make the reservation, which is almost always the case.  This
keeps us from hitting ENOSPC aborts in these odd occurrences where we've
not kept up with the delayed work.

Fixing this in a complete way is going to be relatively complicated and
time consuming.  This patch is what I discussed with Filipe earlier this
year, and what I put into our kernels inside FB.  With this patch we're
down to 1-2 ENOSPC aborts per week, which is a significant reduction.
This is a decent stop gap until we can work out a more wholistic
solution to these two corner cases.
