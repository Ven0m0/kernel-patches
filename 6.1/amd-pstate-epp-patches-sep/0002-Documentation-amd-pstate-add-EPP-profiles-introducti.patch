Subject: [PATCH 02/13] Documentation: amd-pstate: add EPP profiles
 introduction

The patch add AMD pstate EPP feature introduction and what EPP
preference supported for AMD processors.

User can get supported list from
energy_performance_available_preferences attribute file, or update
current profile to energy_performance_preference file

1) See all EPP profiles
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_available_preferences
default performance balance_performance balance_power power

2) Check current EPP profile
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
performance

3) Set new EPP profile
$ sudo bash -c "echo power > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference"

+
+A list of all the supported EPP preferences that could be used for
+``energy_performance_preference`` on this system.
+These profiles represent different hints that are provided

+``energy_performance_preference``
+
+The current energy performance preference can be read from this attribute.
+and user can change current preference according to energy or performance needs
+Please get all support profiles list from
+``energy_performance_available_preferences`` attribute, all the profiles are
+integer values defined between 0 to 255 when EPP feature is enabled by platform
+firmware, if EPP feature is disabled, driver will ignore the written value
+This attribute is read-write.

 Other performance and frequency values can be read back from
