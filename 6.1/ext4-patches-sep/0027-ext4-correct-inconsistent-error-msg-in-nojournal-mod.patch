Subject: [PATCH 27/58] ext4: correct inconsistent error msg in nojournal mode

When we used the journal_async_commit mounting option in nojournal mode,
the kernel told me that "can't mount with journal_checksum", was very
confusing. I find that when we mount with journal_async_commit, both the
JOURNAL_ASYNC_COMMIT and EXPLICIT_JOURNAL_CHECKSUM flags are set. However,
in the error branch, CHECKSUM is checked before ASYNC_COMMIT. As a result,
the above inconsistency occurs, and the ASYNC_COMMIT branch becomes dead
code that cannot be executed. Therefore, we exchange the positions of the
two judgments to make the error msg more accurate.
