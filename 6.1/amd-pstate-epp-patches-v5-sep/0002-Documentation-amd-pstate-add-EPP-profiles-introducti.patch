Subject: [PATCH 02/13] Documentation: amd-pstate: add EPP profiles
 introduction

The amd-pstate driver supports a feature called energy performance
preference (EPP). Add information to the documentation to explain
how users can interact with the sysfs files for this feature.

1) See all EPP profiles
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_available_preferences
default performance balance_performance balance_power power

2) Check current EPP profile
$ sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference
performance

3) Set new EPP profile
$ sudo bash -c "echo power > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference"

+A list of all the supported EPP preferences that could be used for

+These profiles represent different hints that are provided

+The current energy performance preference can be read from this attribute.

+Please get all support profiles list from
+``energy_performance_available_preferences`` attribute, all the profiles are
+integer values defined between 0 to 255 when EPP feature is enabled by platform
+firmware, if EPP feature is disabled, driver will ignore the written value
+This attribute is read-write.

 Other performance and frequency values can be read back from
