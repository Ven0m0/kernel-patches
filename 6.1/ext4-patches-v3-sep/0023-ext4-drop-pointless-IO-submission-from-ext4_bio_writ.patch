Subject: [PATCH 23/35] ext4: drop pointless IO submission from
 ext4_bio_write_page()

We submit outstanding IO in ext4_bio_write_page() if we find a buffer we
are not going to write. This is however pointless because we already
handle submission of previous IO in case we detect newly added buffer
head is discontiguous. So just delete the pointless IO submission call.
