Subject: [PATCH 26/58] hwmon: (it87) Set second Super-IO chip in configuration
 mode

On various Gigabyte AM4 boards (AB350, AX370), the second Super-IO chip
(IT8792E) needs to be in configuration mode before accessing the first
due to a bug in IT8792E which otherwise results in LPC bus access errors.
This needs to be done before accessing the first Super-IO chip since
the second chip may have been accessed prior to loading this driver.

The problem is also reported to affect IT8795E, which is used on X299
boards and has the same chip ID as IT8792E (0x8733). It also appears
to affect systems with IT8790E, which is used on some Z97X-Gaming boards
as well as Z87X-OC, and other more recent Gigabyte boards.
