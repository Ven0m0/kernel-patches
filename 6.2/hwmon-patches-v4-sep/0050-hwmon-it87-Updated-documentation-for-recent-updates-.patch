     0 if vbat should report power on value, 1 if vbat should be updated after
     each read. Default is 0. On some boards the battery voltage is provided

     battery life but no information is given in the datasheet.
 
-* fix_pwm_polarity int
+* fix_pwm_polarity bool
     Force PWM polarity to active high (DANGEROUS). Some chips are
     misconfigured by BIOS - PWM values would be inverted. This option tries
     to fix this. Please contact your BIOS manufacturer and ask him for fix.
 
+* force_id short, short
+
+  Force multiple chip ID to specified value, separated by ','.
+  For example "force_id=0x8689,0x8633".  A value of 0 is ignored
+  for that chip.
+  Note: A single force_id value (e.g. "force_id=0x8689") is used for
+  all chips, to only set the first chip use "force_id=0x8689,0".
+  Should only be used for testing.
+
+* ignore_resource_conflict bool
+
+  Similar to acpi_enforce_resources=lax, but only affects this driver.
+  ACPI resource conflicts are ignored if this parameter is provided and
+  set to 1.
+  Provided since there are reports that system-wide acpi_enfore_resources=lax
+  can result in boot failures on some systems.
+  Note: This is inherently risky since it means that both ACPI and this driver
+  may access the chip at the same time. This can result in race conditions and,
+  worst case, result in unexpected system reboots.
