Subject: [PATCH 22/22] cpufreq: amd-pstate: Let user know amd-pstate is
 disabled

Commit 202e683df37c ("cpufreq: amd-pstate: add amd-pstate driver
parameter for mode selection") changed the driver to be disabled by
default, and this can surprise users.

Let users know what happened so they can decide what to do next.
