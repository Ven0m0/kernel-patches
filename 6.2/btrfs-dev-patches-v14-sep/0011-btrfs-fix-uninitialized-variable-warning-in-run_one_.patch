Subject: [PATCH 011/117] btrfs: fix uninitialized variable warning in
 run_one_async_start

With -Wmaybe-uninitialized compiler complains about ret being possibly
uninitialized, which isn't possible as the WQ_ constants are set only
from our code, however we can handle the default case and get rid of the
warning.

The value is set to BLK_STS_IOERR so it does not issue any IO and could
be potentially detected, but this is basically a "cannot happen" error.
To catch any problems during development use the assert.
