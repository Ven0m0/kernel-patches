Subject: [PATCH 1/6] ksm: abstract the function try_to_get_old_rmap_item

A new function try_to_get_old_rmap_item is abstracted from
get_next_rmap_item. This function will be reused by the subsequent
patches about counting ksm_zero_pages.

The patch improves the readability and reusability of KSM code.
