Subject: [PATCH 20/39] mm/mprotect: Exclude shadow stack from preserve_write

In change_pte_range(), when a PTE is changed for prot_numa, _PAGE_RW is
preserved to avoid the additional write fault after the NUMA hinting fault.
However, pte_write() now includes both normal writable and shadow stack
(Write=0, Dirty=1) PTEs, but the latter does not have _PAGE_RW and has no
need to preserve it.

Exclude shadow stack from preserve_write test, and apply the same change to
change_huge_pmd().
