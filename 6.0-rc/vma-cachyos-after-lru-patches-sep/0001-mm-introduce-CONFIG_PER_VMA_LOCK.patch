Subject: [PATCH 01/28] mm: introduce CONFIG_PER_VMA_LOCK

This configuration variable will be used to build the support for VMA
locking during page fault handling.

This is enabled by default on supported architectures with SMP and MMU
set.

The architecture support is needed since the page fault handler is called
from the architecture's page faulting code which needs modifications to
handle faults under VMA lock.
