Subject: [PATCH 1/4] mm: introduce 'encoded' page pointers with embedded extra
 bits

We already have this notion in parts of the MM code (see the mlock code
with the LRU_PAGE and NEW_PAGE bits), but I'm going to introduce a new
case, and I refuse to do the same thing we've done before where we just
put bits in the raw pointer and say it's still a normal pointer.

So this introduces a 'struct encoded_page' pointer that cannot be used
for anything else than to encode a real page pointer and a couple of
extra bits in the low bits.  That way the compiler can trivially track
the state of the pointer and you just explicitly encode and decode the
extra bits.

Note that this makes the alignment of 'struct page' explicit even for
the case where CONFIG_HAVE_ALIGNED_STRUCT_PAGE is not set.  That is
entirely redundant in almost all cases, since the page structure already
contains several word-sized entries.

However, on m68k, the alignment of even 32-bit data is just 16 bits, and
as such in theory the alignment of 'struct page' could be too.  So let's
just make it very very explicit that the alignment needs to be at least
32 bits, giving us a guarantee of two unused low bits in the pointer.

Now, in practice, our page struct array is aligned much more than that
anyway, even on m68k, and our existing code in mm/mlock.c obviously
already depended on that.  But since the whole point of this change is
to be careful about the type system when hiding extra bits in the
pointer, let's also be explicit about the assumptions we make.

NOTE! This is being very careful in another way too: it has a build-time
assertion that the 'flags' added to the page pointer actually fit in the
two bits.  That means that this helper must be inlined, and can only be
used in contexts where the compiler can statically determine that the
value fits in the available bits.
