Subject: [PATCH 10/12] Documentation: introduce amd pstate active mode kernel
 command line options

AMD Pstate driver support another firmware based autonomous mode
with "amd_pstate=active" added to the kernel command line.
In autonomous mode SMU firmware decides frequencies at 1 ms timescale
based on workload utilization, usage in other IPs, infrastructure
limits such as power, thermals and so on.
