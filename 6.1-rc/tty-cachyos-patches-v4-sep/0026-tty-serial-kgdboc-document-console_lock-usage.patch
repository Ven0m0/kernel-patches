Subject: [PATCH 26/59] tty: serial: kgdboc: document console_lock usage

kgdboc_earlycon_init() uses the console_lock to ensure that no consoles
are unregistered until the kgdboc_earlycon is setup. This is necessary
because the trapping of the exit() callback assumes that the exit()
callback is not called before the trap is setup.

Explicitly document this non-typical console_lock usage.
