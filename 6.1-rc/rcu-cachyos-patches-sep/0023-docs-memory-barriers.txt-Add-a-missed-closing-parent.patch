Subject: [PATCH 23/93] docs/memory-barriers.txt: Add a missed closing
 parenthesis

The description of io_stop_wc(), which was added by commit d5624bb29f49
("asm-generic: introduce io_stop_wc() and add implementation for ARM64"),
has an unclosed parenthesis.  This commit closes it.

Fixes: d5624bb29f49 ("asm-generic: introduce io_stop_wc() and add implementation for ARM64")

      such wait has performance implications.
