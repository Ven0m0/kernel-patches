Subject: [PATCH 16/25] sched/psi: Fix possible missing or delayed pending
 event

When a pending event exists and growth is less than the threshold, the
current logic is to skip this trigger without generating event. However,
from e6df4ead85d9 ("psi: fix possible trigger missing in the window"),
our purpose is to generate event as long as pending event exists and the
rate meets the limit, no matter what growth is.
This patch handles this case properly.

Fixes: e6df4ead85d9 ("psi: fix possible trigger missing in the window")
