Subject: [PATCH 16/16] mm/cgroup/reclaim: fix dirty pages throttling on cgroup
 v1

balance_dirty_pages doesn't do the required dirty throttling on cgroupv1.
See commit 9badce000e2c ("cgroup, writeback: don't enable cgroup writeback
on traditional hierarchies").  Instead, the kernel depends on writeback
throttling in shrink_folio_list to achieve the same goal.  With large
memory systems, the flusher may not be able to writeback quickly enough
such that we will start finding pages in the shrink_folio_list already in
writeback.  Hence for cgroupv1 let's do a reclaim throttle after waking up
the flusher.

The below test which used to fail on a 256GB system completes till the the
file system is full with this change.

root@lp2:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory# mkdir test
root@lp2:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory# cd test/
root@lp2:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test# echo 120M > memory.limit_in_bytes
root@lp2:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test# echo $$ > tasks
root@lp2:/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test# dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/kvaneesh/test bs=1M
