Subject: [PATCH 19/40] printk: console_flush_on_panic: use srcu console list
 iterator

With SRCU it is now safe to traverse the console list, even if
the console_trylock() failed. However, overwriting console->seq
when console_trylock() failed is still an issue.

Switch to SRCU iteration and document remaining issue with
console->seq.
