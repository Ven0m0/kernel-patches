Subject: [PATCH 13/40] proc: consoles: document console_lock usage

The console_lock is held throughout the start/show/stop procedure
to print out device/driver information about all registered
consoles. Since the console_lock is being used for multiple reasons,
explicitly document these reasons. This will be useful when the
console_lock is split into fine-grained locking.
