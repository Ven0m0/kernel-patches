Subject: [PATCH 27/55] block, bfq: make waker-queue detection more robust

In the presence of many parallel I/O flows, the detection of waker
bfq_queues suffers from false positives. This commits addresses this
issue by making the filtering of actual wakers more selective. In more
detail, a candidate waker must be found to meet waker requirements
three times before being promoted to actual waker.

+ * Turning back to the detection of a waker queue, a queue Q is deemed

+ * that Q is detected, the field waker_bfqq is set to Q, to confirm

+ * The sooner a waker queue is detected, the sooner throughput can be
+ * boosted by injecting I/O from the waker queue. Fortunately,
+ * detection is likely to be actually fast, for the following

+ * time. This implies that bfqq's inject limit is at least equal to 1
+ * (see the comments in bfq_update_inject_limit()). So, thanks to
