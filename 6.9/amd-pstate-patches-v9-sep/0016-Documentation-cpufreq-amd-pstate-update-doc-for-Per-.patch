Subject: [PATCH 16/35] Documentation: cpufreq: amd-pstate: update doc for Per
 CPU boost control method

Updates the documentation in `amd-pstate.rst` to include information about the
per CPU boost control feature. Users can now enable or disable the Core Performance
Boost (CPB) feature on individual CPUs using the `boost` sysfs attribute.

+``boost``
+The `boost` sysfs attribute provides control over the CPU core
+performance boost, allowing users to manage the maximum frequency limitation
+of the CPU. This attribute can be used to enable or disable the boost feature
+on individual CPUs.
+
+When the boost feature is enabled, the CPU can dynamically increase its frequency
+beyond the base frequency, providing enhanced performance for demanding workloads.
+On the other hand, disabling the boost feature restricts the CPU to operate at the
+base frequency, which may be desirable in certain scenarios to prioritize power
+efficiency or manage temperature.
+
+To manipulate the `boost` attribute, users can write a value of `0` to disable the
+boost or `1` to enable it, for the respective CPU using the sysfs path
+`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/boost`, where `X` represents the CPU number.
+
+It is important to note that modifying the global variable
+`amd_pstate_global_params.cpb_boost` will override the individual CPU settings.
+
+
 Other performance and frequency values can be read back from
 ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/acpi_cppc/``, see :ref:`cppc_sysfs`.
