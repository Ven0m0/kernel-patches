We are clearing the bit and waking up any waiters in two different
places.  Factor that code out into a static helper function.

Subject: [PATCH 02/10] btrfs: WARN if EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE is set while
 reading

We recently tracked down a race condition that triggered a read for an
extent buffer with EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE already set.  While this read
was in progress, other concurrent readers would see the UPTODATE bit and
return early as if the read was already complete, making accesses to the
extent buffer conflict with the read operation that was overwriting it.

Add a WARN_ON() to end_bbio_meta_read() for this situation to make
similar races easier to spot in the future.

Subject: [PATCH 03/10] md/raid5: fix deadlock between md0_reclaim and
 md0_raid5

Commit 5e2cf333b7bd ("md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d") introduced a regression, it got reverted through commit
bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in
raid5d"). To fix the original issue commit 5e2cf333b7bd was fixing,
commit d6e035aad6c0 ("md: bypass block throttle for superblock update")
was created, it avoids md superblock write getting throttled by block
layer which is good, but md superblock write could be stuck in block
layer due to block flush as well, and that is what was happening in this
regression report.

Process "md0_reclaim" got stuck while waiting IO for md superblock write
done, that IO was marked with REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA flags, these 3
steps ( PREFLUSH, DATA and POSTFLUSH ) will be executed before done, the
hung of this process is because the last step "POSTFLUSH" never done.
And that was because of  process "md0_raid5" submitted another IO with
REQ_FUA flag marked just before that step started. To handle that IO,
blk_insert_flush() will be invoked and hit "REQ_FSEQ_DATA |
REQ_FSEQ_POSTFLUSH" case where "fq->flush_data_in_flight" will be
increased. When the IO for md superblock write was to issue "POSTFLUSH"
step through blk_kick_flush(), it found that "fq->flush_data_in_flight"
was not zero, so it will skip that step, that is expected, because flush
will be triggered when "fq->flush_data_in_flight" dropped to zero.

Unfortunately here that inflight data IO from "md0_raid5" will never
done, because it was added into the blk_plug list of that process, but
"md0_raid5" run into infinite loop due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" which
made it never had a chance to finish the blk plug until
"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING" was cleared. Process "md0_reclaim" was supposed
to clear that flag but it was stuck by "md0_raid5", so this is a deadlock.

Once "md0_raid5" starts looping due to "MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING", it should
release all its staging IO requests to avoid blocking others.

The "i++" was accidentally left out so it just sets qgids[0] over and

This can lead to unexpected problems, as the groups[1:] would be all 0,
leading to later find_qgroup_rb() unable to find a qgroup and cause
snapshot creation failure.

Subject: [PATCH 05/10] btrfs: qgroup: update rescan message levels and error
 codes

On filesystems without enabled quotas there's still a warning message in
the logs when rescan is called. In that case it's not a problem that
should be reported, rescan can be called unconditionally.  Change the
error code to ENOTCONN which is used for 'quotas not enabled' elsewhere.

Remove message (also a warning) when rescan is called during an ongoing
rescan, this brings no useful information and the error code is
sufficient.

Change message levels to debug for now, they can be removed eventually.

Subject: [PATCH 06/10] btrfs: qgroup: fix qgroup id collision across mounts

If we delete subvolumes whose ID is the largest in the filesystem, then
unmount and mount again, then btrfs_init_root_free_objectid on the
tree_root will select a subvolid smaller than that one and thus allow
reusing it.

If we are also using qgroups (and particularly squotas) it is possible
to delete the subvol without deleting the qgroup. In that case, we will
be able to create a new subvol whose id already has a level 0 qgroup.
This will result in re-using that qgroup which would then lead to
incorrect accounting.

Subject: [PATCH 07/10] btrfs: re-introduce 'norecovery' mount option

Although 'norecovery' mount option was marked as deprecated for a long
time and a warning message was printed during the deprecation window,
it's still actively utilized by several projects that need a safer way
to mount a btrfs without any writes.

Furthermore this 'norecovery' mount option is supported by other major
filesystems, which makes it less clear what's our motivation to remove
it.

Re-introduce the 'norecovery' mount option, and output a message to recommend
'rescue=nologreplay' option.

Subject: [PATCH 09/10] md/raid5: fix deadlock that raid5d() wait for itself to
 clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING

Xiao reported that lvm2 test lvconvert-raid-takeover.sh can hang with
small possibility, the root cause is exactly the same as commit
bed9e27baf52 ("Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d"")

However, Dan reported another hang after that, and junxiao investigated
the problem and found out that this is caused by plugged bio can't issue
from raid5d().

Current implementation in raid5d() has a weird dependence:

1) md_check_recovery() from raid5d() must hold 'reconfig_mutex' to clear
   MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING;
2) raid5d() handles IO in a deadloop, until all IO are issued;
3) IO from raid5d() must wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING to be cleared;

This behaviour is introduce before v2.6, and for consequence, if other
context hold 'reconfig_mutex', and md_check_recovery() can't update
super_block, then raid5d() will waste one cpu 100% by the deadloop, until
'reconfig_mutex' is released.

Refer to the implementation from raid1 and raid10, fix this problem by
skipping issue IO if MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING is still set after
md_check_recovery(), daemon thread will be woken up when 'reconfig_mutex'
is released. Meanwhile, the hang problem will be fixed as well.

Subject: [PATCH 10/10] x86/topology/amd: Evaluate SMT in CPUID leaf 0x8000001e
 only on family 0x17 and greater

The new AMD/HYGON topology parser evaluates the SMT information in CPUID leaf
0x8000001e unconditionally while the original code restricted it to CPUs with
family 0x17 and greater.

This breaks family 0x15 CPUs which advertise that leaf and have a non-zero
value in the SMT section. The machine boots, but the scheduler complains loudly
about the mismatch of the core IDs:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/core.c:6482 sched_cpu_starting+0x183/0x250
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/sched/topology.c:2408 build_sched_domains+0x76b/0x12b0

Add the condition back to cure it.

  [ bp: Make it actually build because grandpa is not concerned with
    trivial stuff. :-P ]

Fixes: f7fb3b2dd92c ("x86/cpu: Provide an AMD/HYGON specific topology parser")
