Subject: [PATCH 22/22] cpufreq: amd-pstate: enable shared memory type CPPC by
 default

The amd-pstate-epp driver has been implemented and resolves the
performance drop issue seen in passive mode. Users who enable the
active mode driver will not experience a performance drop compared
to the passive mode driver. Therefore, the EPP driver should be
loaded by default at system boot.
