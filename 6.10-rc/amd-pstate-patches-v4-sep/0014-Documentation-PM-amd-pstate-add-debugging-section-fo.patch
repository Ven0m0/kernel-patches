Subject: [PATCH 14/24] Documentation: PM: amd-pstate: add debugging section
 for driver loading failure

To address issues with the loading of the amd-pstate driver on certain platforms,
It needs to enable dynamic debugging to capture debug messages during the driver
loading process. By adding "amd_pstate.dyndbg=+p cppc_acpi.dyndbg=+p  loglevel=4 debug
amd_pstate=active" to the kernel command line, driver debug logging is enabled.

+Debugging AMD P-State Driver Loading Issues
+------------------------------------------
+
+On some platforms, there may be issues with the loading of the amd-pstate driver.
+To capture debug messages for issue analysis, users can add below parameter,
+"amd_pstate.dyndbg=+p cppc_acpi.dyndbg=+p debug"
+to the kernel command line. This will enable dynamic debugging and allow better
+analysis and troubleshooting of the driver loading process.
+
+Please note that adding this parameter will only enable debug logging during the
+driver loading phase and may affect system behavior. Use this option with caution
+and only for debugging purposes.
