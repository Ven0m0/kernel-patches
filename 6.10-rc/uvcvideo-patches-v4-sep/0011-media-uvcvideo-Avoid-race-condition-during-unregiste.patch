Subject: [PATCH 11/20] media: uvcvideo: Avoid race condition during unregister

The control events are handled asynchronously by the driver. Once the
control event are handled, the urb is re-submitted.

If we simply kill the urb, there is a chance that a control event is
waiting to be processed, which will re-submit the urb after the device is
disconnected.

uvc_status_suspend() flushes the async controls and stops the urb in a
correct manner.
