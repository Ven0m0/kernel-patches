Subject: [PATCH 06/26] cpu/hotplug: Add dynamic parallel bringup states before
 CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU

There is often significant latency in the early stages of CPU bringup,
and time is wasted by waking each CPU (e.g. with SIPI/INIT/INIT on x86)
and then waiting for it to respond before moving on to the next.

Allow a platform to register a set of pre-bringup CPUHP states to which
each CPU can be stepped in parallel, thus absorbing some of that latency.

There is a subtlety here: even with an empty CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_DYN step,
this means that *all* CPUs are brought through the prepare states and to
CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN before any of them are taken to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU
and then are allowed to run for themselves to CPUHP_ONLINE.

So any combination of prepare/start calls which depend on A-B ordering
for each CPU in turn, such as the X2APIC code which used to allocate a
cluster mask 'just in case' and store it in a global variable in the
prep stage, then potentially consume that preallocated structure from
the AP and set the global pointer to NULL to be reallocated in
CPUHP_X2APIC_PREPARE for the next CPU... would explode horribly.

Any platform enabling the CPUHP_BP_PARALLEL_DYN steps must be reviewed
and tested to ensure that such issues do not exist, and the existing
behaviour of bringing CPUs to CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN and then immediately
to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and CPUHP_ONLINE only one at a time does not change
unless such a state is registered.

Note that the new parallel stages do *not* yet bring each AP to the
CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU state at the same time, only to the new states which
exist before it. The final loop in bringup_nonboot_cpus() is untouched,
bringing each AP in turn from the final PARALLEL_DYN state (or all the
way from CPUHP_OFFLINE) to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU and then waiting for that
AP to do its own processing and reach CPUHP_ONLINE before releasing the
next.

Parallelising that part by bringing them all to CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU
and then waiting for them all is an exercise for the future.
