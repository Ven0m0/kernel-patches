Subject: [PATCH 22/26] x86/Documentation: Add documentation about cluster

x86 processors map cluster to the L2 cache. Add documentation stating
the same, and provide more information on the values and API related to
CPU clusters exposed by the kernel.

+Clusters
+========
+A cluster consists of 1 or more threads. It does not matter whether the threads
+are SMT- or CMT-type threads. All the threads of a cluster share the same L2
