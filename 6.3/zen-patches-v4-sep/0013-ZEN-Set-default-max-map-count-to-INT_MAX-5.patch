Subject: [PATCH 13/15] ZEN: Set default max map count to (INT_MAX - 5)

Per Fedora, they intend to change the default max map count for their
distribution to improve OOTB compatibility with games played through
Steam/Proton.  The value they picked comes from the Steam Deck where
valve defaults to INT_MAX - 5. [1]

Since most Zen Kernel / Liquorix users probably play games, follow
Valve's lead and raise this value to their default.
