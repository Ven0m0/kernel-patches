Subject: [PATCH 022/108] ext4: allow to find by goal if EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY
 is set

If EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is set, ext4_mb_regular_allocator will only
allocate blocks from ext4_mb_find_by_goal. Allow to find by goal in
ext4_mb_find_by_goal if EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is set or allocation
with EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY set will always fail.

EXT4_MB_HINT_GOAL_ONLY is not used at all, so the problem is not
found for now.
