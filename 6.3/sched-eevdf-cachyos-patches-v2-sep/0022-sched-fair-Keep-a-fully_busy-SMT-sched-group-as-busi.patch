Subject: [PATCH 22/47] sched/fair: Keep a fully_busy SMT sched group as
 busiest

When comparing two fully_busy scheduling groups, keep the current busiest
group if it represents an SMT core. Tasks in such scheduling group share
CPU resources and need more help than tasks in a non-SMT fully_busy group.
