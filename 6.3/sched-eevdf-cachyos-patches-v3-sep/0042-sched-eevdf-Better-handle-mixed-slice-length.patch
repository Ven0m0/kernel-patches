Subject: [PATCH 42/44] sched/eevdf: Better handle mixed slice length

In the case where (due to latency-nice) there are different request
sizes in the tree, the smaller requests tend to be dominated by the
larger. Also note how the EEVDF lag limits are based on r_max.

Therefore; add a heuristic that for the mixed request size case, moves
smaller requests to placement strategy #2 which ensures they're
immidiately eligible and and due to their smaller (virtual) deadline
will cause preemption.

NOTE: this relies on update_entity_lag() to impose lag limits above
a single slice.
