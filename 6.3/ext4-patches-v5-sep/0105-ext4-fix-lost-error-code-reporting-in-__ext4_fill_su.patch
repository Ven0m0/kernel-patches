Subject: [PATCH 105/106] ext4: fix lost error code reporting in
 __ext4_fill_super()

When code was factored out of __ext4_fill_super() into
ext4_percpu_param_init() the error return was discarded.  This meant
that it was possible for __ext4_fill_super() to return zero,
indicating success, without the struct super getting completely filled
in, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference.
