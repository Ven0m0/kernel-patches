Subject: [PATCH 1/9] kallsyms: expand symbol name into comment for debugging

The assembler output of kallsyms.c is not meant for people to understand,
and is generally not helpful when debugging "Inconsistent kallsyms data"
warnings. I have previously struggled with these, but found it helpful
to list which symbols changed between the first and second pass in the
.tmp_vmlinux.kallsyms*.S files.

As this file is preprocessed, it's possible to add a C-style multiline
comment with the full type/name tuple.
