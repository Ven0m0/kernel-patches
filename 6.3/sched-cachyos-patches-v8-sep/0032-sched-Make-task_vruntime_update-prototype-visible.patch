Subject: [PATCH 32/34] sched: Make task_vruntime_update() prototype visible

Having the prototype next to the caller but not visible to the callee causes
a W=1 warning:

kernel/sched/fair.c:11985:6: error: no previous prototype for 'task_vruntime_update' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]

Move this to a header, as we do for all other function declarations.
