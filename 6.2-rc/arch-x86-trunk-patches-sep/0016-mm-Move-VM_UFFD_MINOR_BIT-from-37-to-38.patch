Subject: [PATCH 16/41] mm: Move VM_UFFD_MINOR_BIT from 37 to 38

The x86 Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) feature includes a new
type of memory called shadow stack. This shadow stack memory has some
unusual properties, which requires some core mm changes to function
properly.

Future patches will introduce a new VM flag VM_SHADOW_STACK that will be
VM_HIGH_ARCH_BIT_5. VM_HIGH_ARCH_BIT_1 through VM_HIGH_ARCH_BIT_4 are
bits 32-36, and bit 37 is the unrelated VM_UFFD_MINOR_BIT. For the sake
of order, make all VM_HIGH_ARCH_BITs stay together by moving
VM_UFFD_MINOR_BIT from 37 to 38. This will allow VM_SHADOW_STACK to be
introduced as 37.
