Subject: [PATCH 08/41] x86/fpu: Add helper for modifying xstate

Just like user xfeatures, supervisor xfeatures can be active in the
registers or present in the task FPU buffer. If the registers are
active, the registers can be modified directly. If the registers are
not active, the modification must be performed on the task FPU buffer.

When the state is not active, the kernel could perform modifications
directly to the buffer. But in order for it to do that, it needs
to know where in the buffer the specific state it wants to modify is
located. Doing this is not robust against optimizations that compact
the FPU buffer, as each access would require computing where in the
buffer it is.

The easiest way to modify supervisor xfeature data is to force restore
the registers and write directly to the MSRs. Often times this is just fine
anyway as the registers need to be restored before returning to userspace.
Do this for now, leaving buffer writing optimizations for the future.

Add a new function fpregs_lock_and_load() that can simultaneously call
fpregs_lock() and do this restore. Also perform some extra sanity
checks in this function since this will be used in non-fpu focused code.
