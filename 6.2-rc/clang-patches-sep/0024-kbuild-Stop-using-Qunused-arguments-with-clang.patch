Subject: [PATCH 24/24] kbuild: Stop using '-Qunused-arguments' with clang

This option masks all unused command line argument warnings, which can
hide potential issues, such as an architecture Makefile adding an
unsupported flag to KBUILD_AFLAGS or KBUILD_CFLAGS, which will cause all
as-option and cc-options to silently fail due to -Werror with no
indication as to why in the main kernel build.

Remove this flag so that warnings of this nature can be caught early and
obviously in a build.
