+For easier development of such systems, DAMON provides a feature called DAMOS

+operations with no code but simple configurations.

+DAMON Maintainer Entry Profile
+==============================
+
+The DAMON subsystem covers the files that listed in 'DATA ACCESS MONITOR'
+section of 'MAINTAINERS' file.
+
+The mailing lists for the subsystem are damon@lists.linux.dev and
+linux-mm@kvack.org.  Patches should be made against the mm-unstable tree [1]_
+whenever possible and posted to the mailing lists.
+
+SCM Trees
+---------
+
+There are multiple Linux trees for DAMON development.  Patches under
+development or testing are queued in damon/next [2]_ by the DAMON maintainer.
+Suffieicntly reviewed patches will be queued in mm-unstable [1]_ by the memory
+management subsystem maintainer.  After more sufficient tests, the patches will
+be queued in mm-stable [3]_ , and finally pull-requested to the mainline by the
+memory management subsystem maintainer.
+
+Note again the patches for review should be made against the mm-unstable
+tree[1] whenever possible.  damon/next is only for preview of others' works in
+progress.
+
+Submit checklist addendum
+-------------------------
+
+When making DAMON changes, you should do below.
+
+- Build changes related outputs including kernel and documents.
+- Ensure the builds introduce no new errors or warnings.
+- Run and ensure no new failures for DAMON selftests [4]_ and kunittests [5]_ .
+
+Further doing below and putting the results will be helpful.
+
+- Run damon-tests/corr [6]_ for normal changes.
+- Run damon-tests/perf [7]_ for performance changes.
+
+Key cycle dates
+---------------
+
+Patches can be sent anytime.  Key cycle dates of the mm-unstable[1] and
+mm-stable[3] trees depend on the memory management subsystem maintainer.
+
+Review cadence
+--------------
+
+The DAMON maintainer does the work on the usual work hour (09:00 to 17:00,
+Mon-Fri) in PST.  The response to patches will occasionally be slow.  Do not
+hesitate to send a ping if you have not heard back within a week of sending a
+patch.
