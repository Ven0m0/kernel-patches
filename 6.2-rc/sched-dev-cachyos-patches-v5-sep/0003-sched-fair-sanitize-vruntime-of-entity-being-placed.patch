Subject: [PATCH 03/14] sched/fair: sanitize vruntime of entity being placed

When a scheduling entity is placed onto cfs_rq, its vruntime is pulled
to the base level (around cfs_rq->min_vruntime), so that the entity
doesn't gain extra boost when placed backwards.

However, if the entity being placed wasn't executed for a long time, its
vruntime may get too far behind (e.g. while cfs_rq was executing a
low-weight hog), which can inverse the vruntime comparison due to s64
overflow.  This results in the entity being placed with its original
vruntime way forwards, so that it will effectively never get to the cpu.

To prevent that, ignore the vruntime of the entity being placed if it
didn't execute for much longer than the characteristic sheduler time
scale.
