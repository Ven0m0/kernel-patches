Subject: [PATCH 23/25] dept: Record the latest one out of consecutive waits of
 the same class

The current code records all the waits for later use to track relation
between waits and events in each context. However, since the same class
is handled the same way, it'd be okay to record only one on behalf of
the others if they all have the same class.

Even though it's the ideal to search the whole history buffer for that,
since it'd cost too high, alternatively, let's keep the latest one at
least when the same class'ed waits consecutively appear.
