Subject: [PATCH 18/18] acpi: cppc: Avoid writing zero value to min and max
 perf

For some cases cppc_set_perf API is called with min and max perf zero,
but on those places author didn't wanted to set those values to zero.
Before recent this API's internal update these value writes are avoided.
But after amd_pstate guided mode introduction those writes are
important. So, write those values only if those are not zero.
