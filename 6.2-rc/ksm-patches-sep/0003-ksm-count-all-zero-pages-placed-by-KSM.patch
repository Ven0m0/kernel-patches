Subject: [PATCH 3/6] ksm: count all zero pages placed by KSM

As pages_sharing and pages_shared don't include the number of zero pages
merged by KSM, we cannot know how many pages are zero pages placed by KSM
when enabling use_zero_pages, which leads to KSM not being transparent with
all actual merged pages by KSM. In the early days of use_zero_pages,
zero-pages was unable to get unshared by the ways like MADV_UNMERGEABLE so
it's hard to count how many times one of those zeropages was then unmerged.

But now, unsharing KSM-placed zero page accurately has been achieved, so we
can easily count both how many times a page full of zeroes was merged with
zero-page and how many times one of those pages was then unmerged. and so,
it helps to estimate memory demands when each and every shared page could
get unshared.

So we add zero_pages_sharing under /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/ to show the number
of all zero pages placed by KSM.
