Subject: [PATCH 15/25] locking/lockdep, cpu/hotplus: Use a weaker annotation
 in AP thread

cb92173d1f0 ("locking/lockdep, cpu/hotplug: Annotate AP thread") was
introduced to make lockdep_assert_cpus_held() work in AP thread.

However, the annotation is too strong for that purpose. We don't have to
use more than try lock annotation for that.

Furthermore, now that Dept was introduced, false positive alarms was
reported by that. Replaced it with try lock annotation.
