Subject: [PATCH 2/8] sched/fair: Choose the CPU where short task is running
 during wake up

The main purpose of this change is to avoid too many cross CPU
wake up when it is unnecessary. The frequent cross CPU wake up
brings significant damage to some workloads, especially on high
core count systems.

This patch set inhibits the cross CPU wake-up by placing the wakee
on waking CPU or previous CPU, if both the waker and wakee are
short-duration tasks.

The first patch is to introduce the definition of a short-duration
task. The second patch leverages the first patch to choose a local
or previous CPU for wakee.

This version is modified based on the following feedback on v2:

1. Peter suggested comparing the duration of waker and the cost to
   scan for an idle CPU: If the cost is higher than the task duration,
   do not waste time finding an idle CPU, choose the local or previous
   CPU directly. A prototype was created based on this suggestion.
   However, according to the test result, this prototype does not inhibit
   the cross CPU wakeup and did not bring improvement. Because the cost
   to find an idle CPU is small in the problematic scenario. The root
   cause of the problem is a race condition between scanning for an idle
   CPU and task enqueue(please refer to the commit log in PATCH 2/2).
   So v3 does not change the core logic of v2, with some refinement based
   on Peter's suggestion.

2. Simplify the logic to record the task duration per Peter and Abel's suggestion.

This change brings overall improvement on some microbenchmarks, both on
Intel and AMD platforms.
