+Users could know something more than the kernel for specific types of memory.
+In the case, users could do their own management for the memory and hence
+doesn't want DAMOS bothers that.  Users could limit DAMOS by setting the access
+pattern of the scheme and/or the monitoring regions for the purpose, but that
+can be inefficient in some cases.  In such cases, users could set non-access
+pattern driven filters using files in this directory.
+
+In the beginning, this directory has only one file, ``nr_filters``.  Writing a
+number (``N``) to the file creates the number of child directories named ``0``
+to ``N-1``.  Each directory represents each filter.  The filters are evaluated
+in the numeric order.
+
+Each filter directory contains three files, namely ``type``, ``matcing``, and
+``memcg_path``.  You can write one of two special keywords, ``anon`` for
+anonymous pages, or ``memcg`` for specific memory cgroup filtering.  In case of
+the memory cgroup filtering, you can specify the memory cgroup of the interest
+by writing the path of the memory cgroup from the cgroups mount point to
+``memcg_path`` file.  You can write ``Y`` or ``N`` to ``matching`` file to
+filter out pages that does or does not match to the type, respectively.  Then,
+the scheme's action will not be applied to the pages that specified to be
+filtered out.
+
+For example, below restricts a DAMOS action to be applied to only non-anonymous
+pages of all memory cgroups except ``/having_care_already``.::
+
+    # echo 2 > nr_filters
+    # # filter out anonymous pages
+    echo anon > 0/type
+    echo Y > 0/matching
+    # # further filter out all cgroups except one at '/having_care_already'
+    echo memcg > 1/type
+    echo /having_care_already > 1/memcg_path
+    echo N > 1/matching
+
+Note that filters could be ignored depend on the running DAMON operations set
+`implementation <sysfs_contexts>`.
