Subject: [PATCH 05/13] sched/fair: fix unfairness at wakeup

At wake up, the vruntime of a task is updated to not be more older than
a sched_latency period behind the min_vruntime. This prevents long sleeping
task to get unlimited credit at wakeup.
Such waking task should preempt current one to use its CPU bandwidth but
wakeup_gran() can be larger than sched_latency, filter out the
wakeup preemption and as a results steals some CPU bandwidth to
the waking task.

Make sure that a task, which vruntime has been capped, will preempt current
task and use its CPU bandwidth even if wakeup_gran() is in the same range
as sched_latency.

If the waking task failed to preempt current it could to wait up to
sysctl_sched_min_granularity before preempting it during next tick.

Strictly speaking, we should use cfs->min_vruntime instead of
curr->vruntime but it doesn't worth the additional overhead and complexity
as the vruntime of current should be close to min_vruntime if not equal.
