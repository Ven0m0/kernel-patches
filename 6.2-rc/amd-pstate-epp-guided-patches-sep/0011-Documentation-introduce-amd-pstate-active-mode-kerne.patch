Subject: [PATCH 11/19] Documentation: introduce amd pstate active mode kernel
 command line options

AMD Pstate driver support another firmware based autonomous mode
with "amd_pstate=active" added to the kernel command line.
In autonomous mode SMU firmware decides frequencies at runtime
based on workload utilization, usage in other IPs, infrastructure
limits such as power, thermals and so on.
